## Introduction

Atlanta is on a growth spree, with skyscrapers sprouting and neighborhoods expanding at an unprecedented rate. As the city transforms, fire safety becomes an ever-critical concern.

### Economic Growth and Urban Expansion

Atlanta's population is booming, with an impressive growth rate of 1.7% annually, fueling its construction surge. From sprawling residential developments to towering commercial structures, the city's skyline is constantly evolving. Midtown and Buckhead are prime examples of areas undergoing significant transformation. With urban growth comes heightened safety demands—where there’s construction, there must be compliance.

### Regulatory and Safety Requirements

Fire safety regulations in Atlanta are stringent, necessitating robust compliance for new constructions.
