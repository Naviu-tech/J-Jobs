## 2. **Can you explain the TIA/EIA 568 color code standards for wiring?**

### Answer:
The TIA/EIA 568 standard specifies two wiring schemes: T568A and T568B. Both use the same eight wires but in different color arrangements. For T568B, the sequence is:

1. White/Orange
2. Orange
3. White/Green
4. Blue
5. White/Blue
6. Green
7. White/Brown
8. Brown

T568A swaps the orange and green pairs, starting with White/Green and Green.

### Why This Answer Works:
It shows familiarity with industry standards and attention to detail, which are vital when terminating cables to avoid connectivity issues.
