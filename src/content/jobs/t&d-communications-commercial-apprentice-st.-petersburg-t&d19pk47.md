You will also be responsible for maintaining a clean and organized worksite, which is essential for preventing accidents and enhancing efficiency. 

In addition to on-the-job training, you will be encouraged to attend apprenticeship classes to further your understanding of electrical concepts and techniques. This role is not only about executing tasks but also about learning and growing within the field, with ample opportunities for career advancement as you develop your skills and expertise.

## Technical Skills & Certifications

As a Commercial Electrical Apprentice, you should possess a high school diploma or equivalent. While enrollment in an apprenticeship program is preferred, your willingness to learn and follow instructions is crucial. A basic understanding of electrical concepts is necessary, and you should be able to work well in a team environment, demonstrating good communication skills.

Technical expertise is a cornerstone of this role.

A significant aspect of your role will involve troubleshooting electrical issues under the guidance of seasoned electricians. This process involves identifying faults, testing circuits, and applying problem-solving techniques to resolve issues efficiently. 

Safety is paramount in the electrical trade. You will be expected to adhere strictly to safety protocols and compliance requirements, which include wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), following lockout/tagout procedures, and participating in regular safety briefings. Documenting your daily tasks and lessons learned is also important for both personal development and project accountability.
