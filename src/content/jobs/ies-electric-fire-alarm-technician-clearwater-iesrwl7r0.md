Experience with programming fire panels is preferred, and excellent communication skills are necessary for coordinating with team members and clients. Attention to detail in documentation is crucial to maintaining accurate records.

Must-have skills include a strong technical aptitude for working with electrical systems, proficiency in using hand and power tools, and the ability to read and interpret technical drawings and specifications. A commitment to safety and quality workmanship is a must, as is the ability to work independently or as part of a team.
