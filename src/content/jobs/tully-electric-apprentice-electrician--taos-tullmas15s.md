## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician at Tully Electric, you'll be an essential part of our team working on a multi-year project in Taos, NM, with additional opportunities in nearby cities such as Española, Santa Fe, and Los Alamos. Your role will be hands-on and dynamic, focusing on installing and maintaining electrical systems in renewable energy projects. Whether it's rooftop solar arrays, battery systems, or EV chargers, you'll gain invaluable experience in the rapidly growing field of clean energy.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

Your day-to-day activities will involve supporting the installation of rooftop solar arrays on commercial properties across Taos and its neighboring areas. You'll assist in running and securing conduit for DC wiring from solar modules to inverters, ensuring all connections are precise and secure. Your responsibilities will include:

- **Wiring and Terminating**: Perform basic wiring tasks, such as terminating PV modules and connecting battery storage systems, under the guidance of experienced electricians.
- **Testing and Troubleshooting**: Learn to test and troubleshoot solar inverters and monitoring systems, identifying and resolving issues to ensure optimal system performance.
- **Material Preparation**: Coordinate material preparation, including pre-assembling racking systems and organizing tools to streamline installation processes.
- **Safety Compliance**: Adhere to safety procedures for rooftop work, including the use of fall protection equipment, to maintain a safe working environment for you and your team.

In addition to these tasks, you'll be expected to assist with site clean-up and inventory management to ensure a smooth workflow.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To succeed as an Apprentice Electrician, you'll need a solid understanding of basic electrical principles, particularly in DC power systems. You'll be working outdoors, often on rooftops, so a willingness to work in varying weather conditions is essential. Key skills and qualifications include:

- **Technical Aptitude**: Ability to follow technical instructions for assembling and wiring renewable energy systems accurately.
- **Organizational Skills**: Strong organizational skills for material handling and job site preparation, ensuring efficiency and safety.
- **Hands-On Experience**: 1-4 years in the field as an Apprentice Electrician will be beneficial, though eager learners with less experience will also be considered.
- **Tool Proficiency**: Comfortable working with hand tools and basic testing equipment, demonstrating a hands-on ability to contribute effectively on site.
