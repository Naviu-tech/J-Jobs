At Mirapath, right here in Denton, TX, we're on the lookout for a Cable Installer to join our team. You'll be diving into commercial projects not just in Denton, but also in nearby cities like Lewisville, Flower Mound, and Frisco. This is an entry-level gig, perfect for anyone eager to learn about electrical systems, lighting controls, and life safety installations. You'll be learning from the pros, working under the supervision of a journeyman, and getting a real feel for what it's like to work on commercial sites.

- Some basic electrical knowledge and the ability to read construction drawings.
- Proficiency with hand tools and a valid driver’s license.
- The physical ability to lift heavy materials and good communication skills.
- Basic computer skills and a commitment to keep learning.

For voice data work in a commercial setting, we’re looking for 1-5 years of experience. In Denton, it’ll also be great if you’re familiar with local building codes and have some experience working in our vibrant community.

## Compensation & Benefits

Here’s what we offer:
- A competitive salary ranging from $21.99 to $32.16 per hour, depending on your experience.
- Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage to keep you healthy and happy.
