## Overview of the Assistant Inventory Clerk Role

As an Assistant Inventory Clerk at Lineage Logistics in our bustling Hawthorne warehouse, you'll play a vital role in ensuring our operations run smoothly. Our warehouse is a dynamic environment where precision and efficiency are key. You'll be part of a dedicated team responsible for maintaining the integrity of our inventory system, ensuring that every item is accounted for and readily accessible. This role is perfect for someone who thrives in a fast-paced setting and enjoys working collaboratively to solve problems and improve processes.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Assistant Inventory Clerk

In the role of an Assistant Inventory Clerk, your day begins with conducting daily cycle counts to verify stock levels and ensure inventory accuracy. You'll be responsible for maintaining accurate inventory records using our advanced inventory management software. This involves tracking stock levels, identifying discrepancies, and reporting any issues to your supervisor promptly.

You'll also support inventory audits and reconciliations, ensuring that our records match the physical stock in the warehouse. Collaboration is key in this position, as you'll work closely with the receiving and shipping teams to ensure seamless inventory flow. Two common activities include assisting with the organization of inventory and helping to prepare stock for incoming and outgoing shipments. You may also be called upon to assist with labeling and categorizing items, ensuring everything is in its rightful place.

You should possess basic proficiency with inventory management software and have strong organizational skills to maintain accurate records. Problem-solving skills are crucial for identifying and addressing discrepancies efficiently.

Hands-on abilities, such as the capability to handle physical tasks like lifting and moving inventory, are necessary. Attention to detail and the ability to work well in a team environment will serve you well in this role. Effective communication skills are also important, as you'll often liaise with other departments to ensure inventory accuracy.

## Compensation and Benefits
