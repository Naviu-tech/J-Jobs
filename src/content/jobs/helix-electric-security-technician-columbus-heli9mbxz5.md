Hey there! We're Helix Electric, and we're on the hunt for a savvy Security Systems Technician to join our team in Columbus, OH. If you're passionate about access control systems, video surveillance, and intrusion detection, we want you. You'll be working with platforms like Genetec, Lenel, and AMAG, so experience with these is a must. We work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment, so if you're up for a challenge and ready to dive into the deep end of IP networking and system programming, keep reading!

## Required Experience

We're looking for someone with a bit of experience under their belt - ideally, 3-5 years. But we're not just about the numbers, here's what we're looking for:

- You're an expert in access control systems, video surveillance, and intrusion detection.
- You've got experience with Genetec, Lenel, and AMAG platforms.
- You hold an ESA/NTS certification.
- You've completed OSHA-10 and hold a low voltage license.
- You've got strong knowledge of IP networking and system programming.
- You're comfortable with client training and can communicate complex concepts in a straightforward way.

## Nice to Have

While these arenâ€™t requirements, pointing them out might give you a slight edge:

- Extra experience in the security technician field is always a bonus.
- If you hold additional certifications, we'd love to hear about them.
- Any extra licenses related to the role are a plus.

## Salary and Benefits

We know that your skills are valuable, and we believe in rewarding our team well. You can expect a salary range of $26.25-$34.66 per hour, depending on your experience. We also offer a competitive benefits package to support you both in and out of the workplace.

We're located in the heart of Columbus, OH, but we're just a stone's throw away from neighboring cities like Dublin, Westerville, and Grove City. If you're in the area and this role sounds like a good fit for you, we'd love to hear from you. So, why not take the leap and apply? We can't wait to meet you!
