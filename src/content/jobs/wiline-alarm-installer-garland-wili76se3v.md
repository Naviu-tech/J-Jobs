## What You'll Do as an Alarm Installer

As an Alarm Installer at WiLine in Garland, TX, you'll be an essential part of our team, ensuring the safety and security of various buildings through the meticulous installation of alarm systems. Our current projects range from commercial buildings to residential complexes, each requiring a dedicated approach to meet unique specifications. Day-to-day, your role will involve hands-on installation tasks, coordination with team members, and adherence to safety protocols. Your work will directly contribute to the reliability and effectiveness of the alarm systems we provide, making a tangible impact on the safety of our clients' properties.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Alarm Installer

Your daily routine will start with preparing tools and materials necessary for the day's tasks. This includes ensuring you have all required equipment, such as drills, cable strippers, and wiring materials. You'll assist in the installation of fire alarm systems by pulling low-voltage wiring and securing it within conduits and cable trays. Mounting devices like smoke detectors, pull stations, and notification appliances according to layout plans will be a regular part of your duties.

You'll also perform labeling and basic testing of installed components under the supervision of experienced team members. Maintaining a clean and safe work environment is crucial, so regular cleanup and organization of the workspace will be expected. Collaborating closely with your team to complete installations on schedule is key, as is communicating any issues or delays promptly to ensure project timelines are met.

## What You Need to Be an Alarm Installer

To succeed in this role, you should have a basic knowledge of hand tools, including drills and cable strippers, as well as a familiarity with low-voltage wiring. Strong attention to detail is essential, as is the ability to follow instructions and adhere to safety guidelines. Physical fitness is important, as the job requires lifting up to 50 lbs and working on ladders.

While 0-2 years of experience in the field is preferred, we value hands-on abilities and a willingness to learn. Key skills include problem-solving, effective communication, and teamwork. Being proactive and having a keen eye for detail will set you apart as a valuable member of our installation team.
