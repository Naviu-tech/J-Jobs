The ability to work on lifts and scaffolding is essential, as many of our projects require this expertise. Strong troubleshooting skills are a must, as is experience with lighting control systems. 

Leadership capabilities are also crucial, as you'll be mentoring apprentices, guiding them through complex tasks while ensuring their safety and effectiveness. Ideally, you should have 3-5 years of experience in the field as an Electrician, demonstrating a strong track record of reliability and skill. Key skills include problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to work independently and as part of a team.
