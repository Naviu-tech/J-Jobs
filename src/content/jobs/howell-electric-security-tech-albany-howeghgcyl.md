You’ll test system connectivity to guarantee all components communicate effectively. Troubleshooting is a key part of the job; if a system isn't functioning as it should, it’s up to you to identify the problem and fix it. Maintaining installation logs is also crucial, as it ensures that we have a detailed record of all work done for future reference. Regularly, you'll liaise with clients to demonstrate how their new systems work, ensuring they feel confident in using them. Additionally, you'll conduct routine maintenance checks and software updates to preempt any potential issues.

Your attention to detail will ensure that installations are precise and systems operate flawlessly. Effective customer service skills are a must, as you'll often be the face of Howell Electric when interacting with clients. Your ability to explain complex systems in simple terms will help build trust and satisfaction with our services.
