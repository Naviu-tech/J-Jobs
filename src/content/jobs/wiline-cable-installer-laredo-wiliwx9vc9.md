## What You'll Do as a Cable Installer

As a Cable Installer with WiLine in Laredo, TX, you’ll be the backbone of our communication infrastructure projects. You'll be working on both new construction sites and retrofit environments, ensuring that our clients have reliable and efficient cabling systems. Your role is crucial to connecting people and businesses with the world, and we’re currently expanding our operations to meet the growing demand in Laredo. This job is hands-on and involves a mix of technical expertise and physical work. You'll be responsible for turning plans on paper into functional network systems.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Cable Installer

### Installing and Testing Cabling Systems

Your main responsibility will be to install structured cabling systems, including Cat5e, Cat6, and fiber optics. You'll work in diverse environments, from new buildings to existing structures that need retrofitting. Terminating and testing both copper and fiber optic cables using precision tools and testers will be part of your daily routine. 

### Mounting and Securing Network Components

You’ll regularly mount, secure, and label network racks and patch panels. This involves installing cable tray and ladder rack systems, ensuring that all cables are properly routed and supported to avoid disruptions.

### Cable Management and Blueprint Reading

Dressing and bundling cables neatly to meet industry and site-specific standards is crucial. You’ll need to read and follow construction blueprints and cabling diagrams to complete installations accurately. Additionally, coordinating with construction teams to integrate cabling with other infrastructure components will be a part of your day-to-day activities.

### Additional Daily Activities

In addition to these core tasks, you'll often troubleshoot existing cable installations to ensure they meet performance standards. Conducting site surveys to assess cabling needs and providing input on design improvements are also common activities. Keeping detailed records of installations and maintaining an inventory of tools and equipment will be necessary for efficient operations.

## What You Need to Be a Cable Installer

To succeed in this role, you need extensive experience with structured cabling systems. A minimum of 3-5 years in the field as a Cable Installer is expected. Proficiency in terminating both fiber and copper cables and a solid understanding of TIA/EIA cabling standards are must-have skills. You should be adept at reading network blueprints and diagrams, with strong organizational skills for managing tools and inventory. Hands-on abilities, such as using precision tools and testers effectively, are essential for ensuring high-quality installations.
