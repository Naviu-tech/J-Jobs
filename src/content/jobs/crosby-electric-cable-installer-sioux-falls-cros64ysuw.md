Hey there! We're Crosby Electric, and we're on the lookout for a talented Cable Installer to join our team in Sioux Falls, SD. If you're someone who loves working with mission-critical facilities and has a knack for data center infrastructure, you might be just who we need. Sioux Falls is a fantastic place to be, with neighboring cities like Brandon, Harrisburg, and Tea offering a great community to settle into. Our work is all about making sure data centers run smoothly, and we need you to help us do that.

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you'll be designing and installing structured cabling systems for data centers and enterprise networks. You'll also get hands-on with high-density fiber optic cable installations and certify these systems using advanced test equipment. Managing cables properly in network rooms and terminating and testing high-speed copper and fiber connections are key parts of the job. We also count on you to maintain detailed testing documentation and warranties and coordinate pathway installations with other trades.

On top of that, you'll be working on data center hot aisle/cold aisle separation, installing overhead cable trays and ladder rack systems, and keeping up with clean room protocols for sensitive environments. Given the unique needs of the Sioux Falls area, you might also find yourself working with local contractors to ensure compliance with regional cabling standards, assisting on projects that require off-hours work, and adapting installations to suit the local climate challenges.

## Required Qualifications

To be a good fit for this role, you need to have a BICSI Installer 1 certification—Installer 2 is a big plus. We’re looking for someone with demonstrated experience in fiber optic installation and testing, who’s comfortable using multiple certification testers. Understanding data center design principles and having experience with cable management systems and pathways will also come in handy. You'll need to be able to read and create cable installation drawings and understand network hardware requirements.

We require 1-5 years of experience working with voice data in a commercial setting. Since we're in Sioux Falls, having knowledge of local building codes and regulations is important. Experience working in environments with varying climate conditions and familiarity with local industry standards will give you an edge.

## Compensation & Benefits

We believe in taking care of our team. You'll receive a competitive salary ranging from $22.39 to $30.33 per hour, depending on your experience. We've got comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage to keep you and your family healthy. You'll also enjoy paid time off and holidays, along with plenty of opportunities for career advancement. Plus, we offer ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If this sounds like the kind of opportunity you've been looking for, we'd love to hear from you! Join us at Crosby Electric and be part of a team that makes a real difference in the world of data centers.
