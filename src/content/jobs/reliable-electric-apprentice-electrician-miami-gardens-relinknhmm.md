As an Apprentice Electrician at Reliable Electric, you'll be an integral part of our dynamic team working on a multi-year project in Miami Gardens, FL, with additional assignments in neighboring areas such as North Miami, Hialeah, and Opa-locka. This role offers a hands-on opportunity to dive into the exciting field of renewable energy. You'll gain practical experience in installing and maintaining cutting-edge solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations, contributing to sustainable energy solutions for both residential and commercial properties.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician, your day-to-day activities will revolve around supporting our skilled electricians in various tasks. You'll actively participate in the installation of solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations. This involves learning to run conduit, pulling wire, and connecting inverters to electrical panels under the guidance of experienced mentors. You'll develop the ability to interpret system blueprints and layouts, crucial for executing renewable energy projects efficiently.

Your role will also include performing routine inspections and maintenance on installed systems to ensure they operate at peak performance. You'll monitor and troubleshoot system components under the supervision of senior technicians, honing your problem-solving skills. Additionally, you'll be responsible for ensuring all work complies with local building codes and renewable energy guidelines.

Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail are crucial for identifying and resolving issues effectively. You should be willing to travel between job sites and work extended hours when necessary to meet project deadlines.

While a high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, technical coursework in renewable energy is a plus.
