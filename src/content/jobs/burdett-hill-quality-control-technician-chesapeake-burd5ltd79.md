## What You'll Do as a Quality Control Technician

Welcome to the team at Burdett Hill, where quality is our hallmark! As a Quality Control Technician based in Chesapeake, VA, your expertise will be vital in ensuring that our projects maintain the highest standards. We're working on exciting multi-year projects not just here in Chesapeake, but also in nearby cities like Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, and Suffolk. Your role will be central to every project, ensuring that every component meets our rigorous quality standards. 

## Your Daily Tasks as a Quality Control Technician

A day in the life of a Quality Control Technician at Burdett Hill is dynamic and hands-on. You'll start your day by performing dimensional and visual inspections of disassembled electric motors and their parts. Your keen eye for detail will help identify necessary repairs. You'll verify that both new and repaired parts align perfectly with engineering drawings and specifications. Throughout the day, you'll conduct in-process surveillance and perform final inspections, ensuring that every motor is ready for shipment. 

Documentation is crucial, so you'll ensure all paperwork and records are completed accurately and legibly. You'll work closely with machinists and repair technicians, fostering a collaborative environment to meet our quality standards. Common tasks include measuring components using precision tools and identifying any deviations from specifications. You'll also participate in team meetings to discuss quality improvements and solutions to technical challenges.

## What You Need to Be a Quality Control Technician

To thrive in this role, you'll need a high school diploma or equivalent and at least 3 years of hands-on experience with precision measurement tools, such as micrometers, calipers, and dial indicators. The ability to safely lift 50 pounds and work in physically demanding environments is essential. Flexibility is key, as you'll need to be prepared to work overtime, weekends, and holidays when necessary. A background as a military mechanical technician is a plus, as it brings a disciplined approach to the role.

Must-have skills include a strong attention to detail, excellent problem-solving abilities, and effective communication skills to report findings and collaborate with the team. Your hands-on experience and ability to work under pressure will be invaluable in maintaining our high standards of quality.
