Basic electrical knowledge, the ability to read construction drawings, and proficiency with hand tools are key. A valid driver's license and the physical ability to lift heavy materials are also required. Good communication skills and basic computer proficiency will help you succeed. You should have 1-5 years of experience in voice data work in a commercial setting. Familiarity with Carrollton's local building codes and a knack for navigating the area's traffic will give you an edge.
