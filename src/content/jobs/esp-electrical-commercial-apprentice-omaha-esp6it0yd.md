Hey there! Are you looking to kickstart your career in the electrical field? Well, you’re in the right place. We’re ESP Electrical, and we’re on the lookout for a Commercial Apprentice to join our team in Omaha, Nebraska. If you’re located around the Omaha area, like in Bellevue, Papillion, or even as far out as Council Bluffs, you’re still in the neighborhood, and we’d love to hear from you! This is an entry-level gig where you’ll learn the ropes of commercial electrical installation, focusing on new construction and tenant improvement projects. It’s a hands-on role where you'll dive into power distribution, lighting systems, and life safety. We’re all about learning and growth, so if you’re enrolled in or eligible for a state-approved apprenticeship program, that’s a great start!

## Key Responsibilities

As a Commercial Construction Apprentice Electrician, your day-to-day will be full of learning and action. You’ll assist with installing commercial electrical systems, including power distribution and lighting controls. You’ll get to grips with conduit bending and installation techniques for EMT and rigid conduit, help with wire pulling and termination in electrical rooms, and support panel installation and circuit identification. Plus, you’ll assist with lighting fixture installation and learn about controls programming. You’ll also get a taste of building automation system basics and help with emergency lighting installation and testing. Keeping the job site organized and maintaining material inventory is part of the gig too. You’ll document your daily work progress and operate aerial lifts and scaffolding under supervision. We’ll also have you assist with blueprint reading and layout—pretty exciting, right? In the Omaha area, you’ll also get involved in specific tasks like adapting installations to local building codes, supporting projects in varied commercial environments from office towers in downtown Omaha to retail spaces in Westroads Mall, and learning region-specific safety procedures. And don't forget, Nebraska has its own licensing requirements, so you'll get familiar with those too!

## Required Qualifications

So, what do you need to bring to the table? A high school diploma or GED with strong math skills is a must. You should be enrolled in a state-approved electrical apprenticeship program and have a basic understanding of electrical theory. Being able to read basic blueprints and construction drawings will definitely help, as will proficiency with hand tools and power tools. A valid driver’s license with a clean record is essential because you’ll need to get around to various job sites. You’ll also need the ability to lift over 50 pounds regularly and have good communication skills for coordinating on the job site. Basic computer skills for documentation are a plus because keeping track of what’s happening on-site is important. You’ll need to be willing to attend required training classes too. Regarding local specifics, having some familiarity with the regional weather conditions and how they might impact construction work can be beneficial. And a bit of local know-how about navigating Omaha’s urban layout will certainly come in handy.

## Compensation & Benefits

Now, let’s talk about what you get in return. We offer a competitive salary range from $20.09 to $25.55 per hour, depending on your experience. You’ll also have access to comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage because we know health matters. There’s paid time off and holidays too, so you can enjoy some downtime. We’re big on career advancement, so there are plenty of opportunities to grow within the company. Plus, you’ll have access to ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If this sounds like the type of role you’re interested in, and you’re ready to start your journey in the electrical trade, we’d love to hear from you. Let’s build something great together!
