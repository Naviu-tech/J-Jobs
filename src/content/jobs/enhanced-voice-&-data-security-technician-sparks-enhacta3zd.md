Welcome to Enhanced Voice & Data, where we’re on the lookout for a talented Security Technician to join our team in Sparks, NV. If you’re passionate about working in data centers and have a knack for cabling, you might just be the person we need. Our projects span the bustling areas of Reno, Carson City, and beyond, so you’ll get to work in some of the most exciting and dynamic locales in Nevada. We pride ourselves on our innovative approach to voice and data solutions, and we’re excited to bring someone on board who shares our enthusiasm and commitment to excellence.

## Key Responsibilities

As a Security Technician with us, you’ll be at the heart of our operations, ensuring our cabling systems run smoothly and efficiently. You’ll install and certify structured cabling systems, skillfully handle fiber optic terminations, and perform rigorous testing to keep things up to standard. Your role will also include implementing top-notch cable management in data centers, coordinating pathway installations, and adhering to clean room protocols. You’ll get hands-on with cable certification equipment, install overhead cable tray systems, and document every test result and warranty with precision.

In the Sparks area, you’ll also take on responsibilities like collaborating on local projects, including the exciting new data center development in the heart of Sparks. You’ll ensure compliance with Nevada’s regional data center standards and tackle the unique challenges that come with working in this vibrant community. Plus, you’ll help us maintain separation in hot and cold aisle environments, crucial for optimal performance in our facilities.

## Required Qualifications

We’re looking for someone with a BICSI Installer 1 certification and demonstrated experience with structured cabling systems. Proficiency in fiber optic installation and expertise with cable testing equipment are essential. You’ll need a solid grasp of data center infrastructure and experience with documentation systems, along with an understanding of TIA standards and the ability to read and create cable drawings.

For this role, you should bring 1-3 years of experience in security work within a commercial setting. Given our Sparks location, familiarity with Nevada’s specific industry requirements would be a bonus. And if you’re someone who thrives in fast-paced environments and has a keen eye for detail, we’d love to hear from you.

## Compensation & Benefits

We believe in rewarding hard work, so we offer a competitive salary range of $29.14 to $37.14 per hour, depending on your experience. Our benefits package includes comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, as well as paid time off and holidays to ensure you maintain a healthy work-life balance. At Enhanced Voice & Data, we’re committed to your growth, offering career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to help you reach your full potential.

If this sounds like the perfect fit for you, we can’t wait to welcome you to our team in Sparks. Let’s work together to push the boundaries of what’s possible in data center technology!
