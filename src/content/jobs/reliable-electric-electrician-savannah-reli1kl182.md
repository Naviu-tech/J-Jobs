The position involves a blend of technical expertise, hands-on installation, and maintenance of electrical systems, with a strong emphasis on safety and compliance. The ideal candidate will possess a thorough understanding of power distribution systems, lighting controls, and troubleshooting techniques. Key responsibilities include planning and executing electrical installations, performing upgrades, and implementing energy-efficient designs. Additionally, the Commercial Electrician will play a vital role in mentoring apprentices, maintaining detailed documentation, and coordinating with construction teams to ensure seamless project execution. This position requires working at heights, utilizing power tools, and handling various materials, making physical fitness a necessity.

## Technical Skills & Certifications

To excel in this position, candidates must demonstrate proficiency in several technical areas. A relevant electrical certification or licensure is preferred, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of commercial electrical systems. Mastery in reading and interpreting blueprints and technical diagrams is essential, as is hands-on experience with power tools and diagnostic equipment. Strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills are a must, with the ability to quickly identify and resolve issues within complex electrical systems.

Candidates should possess in-depth knowledge of safety protocols and building codes, particularly the National Electrical Code (NEC) and local codes in Georgia. Expertise in using tools such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, and insulation resistance testers is required. Certifications such as the Certified Commercial Electrician (CCE) or a state-specific journeyman electrician license will be highly regarded. Familiarity with specialized tools like conduit benders, wire strippers, and cable cutters will be advantageous.

## Project Responsibilities

As a Commercial Electrician at Reliable Electric, you will be tasked with installing and maintaining electrical systems in diverse commercial settings. This includes troubleshooting and repairing power distribution systems to ensure uninterrupted service.

The role requires meticulous planning and execution of electrical upgrades, from initial design to final implementation. This involves managing materials and tools, ensuring they are available and in good condition for each project. You will coordinate with other construction teams to synchronize project timelines and objectives, ensuring compliance with safety codes throughout.

Regular inspection and testing of installations for quality assurance are critical, requiring detailed documentation of work progress and maintenance records. Mentoring apprentices and junior electricians is an integral part of the role, providing them with on-site technical expertise and guidance. You will also support emergency power system installations and integrate energy-efficient solutions into new and existing designs. 

Safety is paramount; adherence to OSHA regulations and company-specific safety protocols is mandatory. Conducting safety audits and ensuring all team members are equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential.
