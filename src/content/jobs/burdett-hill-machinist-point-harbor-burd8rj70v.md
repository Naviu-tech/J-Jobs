Your ability to communicate effectively, both verbally and in writing, will be essential. The physical demands of the job require you to lift up to 50 pounds and be available for overtime, including weekends and holidays, as needed. Key skills include proficiency in reading blueprints and technical drawings, a strong understanding of machining processes, and hands-on experience with precision measuring instruments like calipers and micrometers.
