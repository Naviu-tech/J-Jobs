## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Install and Maintain Electrical Systems

You'll be responsible for installing and maintaining complex electrical systems in various healthcare environments, including patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units.

### Supervision and Troubleshooting

Your tasks will include supervising apprentices to maintain high safety standards and quality workmanship. Additionally, you'll troubleshoot and test critical electrical systems, including fire alarm circuits, nurse call systems, and life safety equipment. You'll also be expected to perform load calculations and oversee the installation of service equipment, emergency power systems, and backup generators.

### Essential Skills

You should possess experience with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits. The ability to read and interpret complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals is essential. Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters is required, along with strong communication skills to collaborate effectively with diverse teams in high-pressure environments.

### Hands-On Abilities
