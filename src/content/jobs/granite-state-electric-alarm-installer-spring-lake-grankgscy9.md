## What You'll Do as an Alarm Installer

Welcome to Granite State Electric! As an Alarm Installer, you will be an essential part of our team working on a multi-year project in Spring Lake, NC, with exciting opportunities in nearby areas such as Fayetteville, Fort Bragg, and Sanford. Your primary role is to ensure that fire alarm systems are installed efficiently, safely, and up to code. You’ll be hands-on, working closely with a team to protect our communities by setting up crucial safety systems in various residential and commercial properties. This is a practical, boots-on-the-ground role where you’ll see the direct impact of your work daily.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Alarm Installer

Every day as an Alarm Installer at Granite State Electric is dynamic and fulfilling. You’ll assist in the installation of fire alarm systems by pulling and terminating low-voltage wiring. This involves running cables through walls, ceilings, and other structures, ensuring they are neatly organized and secure. You'll mount devices such as smoke detectors, pull stations, and notification appliances according to detailed layout plans, ensuring everything is placed for maximum effectiveness and code compliance.

Other common activities include performing system labeling and basic testing under the supervision of senior installers. This means you’ll be checking that all components are working correctly and adjusting as needed. Preparing materials and tools for daily tasks is also crucial, as it ensures the day runs smoothly and efficiently. Maintaining a clean and organized work environment is a must, not only for safety but also to keep the project moving on schedule. Collaborating with senior installers will be a regular part of your day, as you work together to meet project deadlines and ensure compliance with fire safety codes. Additionally, you might find yourself troubleshooting minor issues as they arise, honing your problem-solving skills on the job.

## What You Need to Be an Alarm Installer

To thrive in this role, you should have a basic knowledge of low-voltage wiring and the associated tools. The ability to follow installation instructions and safety guidelines is crucial, as it ensures the safety of both you and the future occupants of the buildings you work in. Attention to detail is key, as you’ll need to ensure that every component is installed correctly and functions as it should. Physically, you should be comfortable lifting equipment and working on ladders, as these are common aspects of the job.

We’re looking for candidates with 0-2 years of experience in the field as an Alarm Installer. Must-have skills include a solid understanding of electrical systems, familiarity with using hand and power tools, and the ability to read and interpret technical diagrams. Your hands-on abilities will be tested and developed as you work, making this a great opportunity to grow your skill set.
