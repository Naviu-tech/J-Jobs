## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

Welcome to Prime Partners, where we are embarking on an exciting multi-year project in Cambridge, MA, with additional projects in nearby cities such as Somerville, Medford, and Arlington. As an Apprentice Electrician with us, you'll play a vital role in supporting the installation and maintenance of cutting-edge renewable energy systems. This is a hands-on position where you'll be involved in the day-to-day activities that keep our projects running smoothly and efficiently. Your work will primarily focus on the installation of rooftop solar arrays, battery systems, and EV chargers on commercial properties.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

In your role, you'll be responsible for supporting the installation of rooftop solar systems. This includes assisting in running and securing conduit for DC wiring from solar modules to inverters. You'll perform basic wiring tasks, such as terminating PV modules and connecting battery storage systems. Under the supervision of experienced electricians, you'll learn to test and troubleshoot solar inverters and monitoring systems. Your day will also involve coordinating material preparation, pre-assembling racking systems, and ensuring that tools are organized and ready for use. Safety is paramount, so you'll follow all necessary procedures for rooftop work, including the use of fall protection equipment.

Additionally, you may assist in the installation and maintenance of EV chargers, helping to secure mounting brackets and run necessary electrical lines. Conducting routine inspections and maintaining a clean and organized job site will also be part of your daily routine. Your ability to support the team in a variety of tasks will be crucial to the success of our projects.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To thrive as an Apprentice Electrician at Prime Partners, you'll need a solid understanding of basic electrical principles, particularly DC power systems. You'll be working outdoors, often on rooftops, in varying weather conditions, so a willingness to embrace these challenges is essential. The ability to follow technical instructions for assembling and wiring renewable energy systems is crucial. Strong organizational skills will help you manage material handling and job site preparation efficiently. You should be comfortable working with hand tools and basic testing equipment, as these will be part of your daily toolkit.

We require 1-4 years of experience as an Apprentice Electrician. Must-have skills include a keen attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to work collaboratively with a team. Hands-on experience with renewable energy systems is a plus, but a proactive attitude and eagerness to learn are equally valuable.

## Compensation

At Prime Partners, we offer a competitive salary range of $19.74-$25.7 per hour, depending on your experience. We are committed to your growth and offer numerous career advancement opportunities. You'll have access to ongoing training and certifications to enhance your skills and knowledge in the renewable energy field. In addition to a competitive salary, we provide comprehensive benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Join us and become part of a team dedicated to building a sustainable future, while advancing your career as an Apprentice Electrician.
