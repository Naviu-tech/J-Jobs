Nestled in the vibrant city of Boulder, CO, Braco Electrical is on a mission to electrify the future of commercial construction. Situated in the picturesque foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Boulder is surrounded by the charming cities of Longmont, Louisville, and Lafayette, offering a dynamic urban experience with a touch of the great outdoors. As a Commercial Construction Apprentice Electrician at Braco Electrical, you will embark on an electrifying journey, working on groundbreaking new construction and tenant improvement projects.

## Key Responsibilities
As a key player on our team, you'll assist in the installation of cutting-edge commercial electrical systems, including power distribution, lighting controls, and fire alarm systems. Dive into the art of conduit bending and installation techniques for both EMT and rigid conduit. You'll help with wire pulling and termination in electrical rooms, support panel installation, and circuit identification. Get hands-on experience with lighting fixture installation and controls programming, and learn the basics of building automation systems. You’ll assist with emergency lighting installation and testing, maintain material inventory and job site organization, and document your daily work progress. Operate aerial lifts and scaffolding under supervision, and hone your skills in blueprint reading and layout. In the Boulder area, you’ll also have the opportunity to work on sustainable energy projects, leverage solar integration techniques, and explore the latest in green building practices. Regional requirements for Colorado include understanding the local building codes and energy regulations to ensure compliance and safety.

## Required Qualifications

A basic understanding of electrical theory will help you hit the ground running, and the ability to read basic blueprints and construction drawings is essential. You'll need proficiency with hand tools and power tools, a valid driver’s license with a clean record, and the ability to lift 50+ pounds regularly. Good communication skills for job site coordination and basic computer skills for documentation are a must. With 0-3 years of experience required for apprentice work in a commercial setting, this position is perfect for those starting their journey in the electrical field.
