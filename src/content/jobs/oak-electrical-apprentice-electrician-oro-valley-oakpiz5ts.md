Under the guidance of experienced supervisors, you'll be part of a supportive team structure that encourages growth and skill development. Oak Electrical is committed to nurturing your potential, offering pathways to advance within the company, ensuring that your career flourishes alongside our projects.

## Core Apprentice Electrician Responsibilities

As an Apprentice Electrician, your primary role will be to support the installation and maintenance of renewable energy systems, including solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations on both residential and commercial properties. Your responsibilities will include:

- Assisting in running conduit, pulling wire, and connecting inverters to electrical panels.
- Learning to interpret system blueprints and layouts for renewable energy projects.
- Conducting routine inspections and maintenance on installed systems to ensure optimal performance.
- Monitoring and troubleshooting system components under the supervision of senior technicians.
- Ensuring all work complies with local building codes and renewable energy guidelines.
- Maintaining a clean and organized work environment, managing tools and materials on-site.

Advanced technical duties will involve learning intricate wiring techniques, programming inverters, and mastering the installation of complex energy systems specific to our regional projects in places like Oro Valley and Marana. Safety is paramount; thus, adherence to rigorous safety protocols and regulations is essential.

## Required Experience & Skills

The ideal candidate will have familiarity with basic electrical concepts and renewable energy systems, coupled with an eagerness to delve deeper into solar, battery, and EV charging technology. You should be comfortable working outdoors in various weather conditions and at heights, such as on rooftops. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail are crucial, along with the willingness to travel between job sites and work extended hours when necessary. While a high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, technical coursework in renewable energy is a plus. Candidates should have 1-4 years of experience as an Apprentice Electrician, possess essential certifications like OSHA 10, and demonstrate a sound understanding of electrical safety and wiring protocols.

We ensure that you have access to high-quality tools to perform your tasks efficiently and safely.
