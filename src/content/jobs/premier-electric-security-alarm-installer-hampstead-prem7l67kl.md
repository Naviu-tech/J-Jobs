Proficiency with hand tools and power tools is required, as is comfort working at heights on ladders. 

The role requires a valid driver's license and a clean driving record, along with the ability to lift 50+ pounds regularly. Exceptional customer service skills and basic computer proficiency are also necessary. All candidates must be able to pass a background check and drug test, and be comfortable working in various weather conditions. A willingness to be on an on-call rotation is also required.
