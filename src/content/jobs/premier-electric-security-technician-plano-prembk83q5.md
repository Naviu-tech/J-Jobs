## Join Our Team as a Security Technician at Premier Electric!

Hey there! Are you someone who's passionate about technology and security systems? Do you find joy in troubleshooting and setting things right? If that sounds like you, we might just have the perfect role for you at Premier Electric in Plano, TX. We're on the lookout for a skilled Security Technician to join our team and help us ensure that our clients' security systems are up and running smoothly.

### What You'll Be Doing

As a Security Technician with us, you'll have the chance to make a real impact by installing and configuring state-of-the-art security systems. You'll work with tools like crimpers and cable testers to set up CCTV, access control, and intrusion alarms in a variety of settings, from bustling office buildings to expansive warehouses. Your day might involve anything from troubleshooting connectivity issues to performing maintenance on cameras and alarm panels. You'll be the go-to person for integrating systems and ensuring everything works seamlessly.

### What We're Looking For

We're seeking candidates with 1-3 years of experience in security systems and networking. You'll need to be comfortable using diagnostic equipment like cable testers and have a knack for reading technical manuals. Your ability to lift and install equipment is important, as is your valid driver's license. If you're willing to learn and grow with us, you'll fit right in.
