With over two decades of excellence, our team is committed to ensuring the safety and security of the commercial and industrial communities we serve. Our Fire Alarm Installers are at the forefront of this mission, tackling projects that range from retrofitting historic buildings to outfitting cutting-edge facilities with state-of-the-art fire protection systems. As a part of our team, you will be joining a group of highly skilled professionals dedicated to maintaining our reputation for quality, safety, and innovation.

## The Fire Alarm Installer Position

As a Fire Alarm Installer at Alessandro Electric, you'll be part of a dynamic team responsible for safeguarding lives and properties through the installation and maintenance of fire alarm systems. Your day-to-day responsibilities will involve a variety of tasks, from installing and testing new systems to diagnosing and repairing existing ones. You'll work in diverse environments, including high-rise buildings, manufacturing plants, and educational institutions, ensuring that each facility meets strict safety standards.

Our team operates under a well-structured hierarchy where collaboration is key. You'll work closely with project managers, fellow installers, and apprentices, fostering a supportive environment that encourages learning and growth. As Alessandro Electric continues to expand, there are ample opportunities for career advancement, whether you're aspiring to become a lead installer or moving up to a supervisory role.

## Core Fire Alarm Installer Responsibilities

Your primary duties will include installing, testing, and maintaining fire alarm systems, which encompass control panels, pull stations, and notification devices. You will conduct thorough inspections to ensure all components are compliant with California fire code and NFPA standards. Troubleshooting and repairing faulty wiring or devices will be a crucial part of your role, ensuring system reliability and safety.

You'll coordinate with contractors and building managers to plan and execute installations in both new and existing structures. Programming fire alarm systems to integrate with other safety equipment, such as sprinklers and emergency lighting, is another essential task. Keeping detailed service logs and providing documentation for system approvals and inspections are required.

Additional advanced duties include designing customized fire alarm solutions for complex industrial layouts, conducting load calculations to ensure system efficiency, and implementing networked fire alarm systems for integrated safety management across large facilities.

Given the diverse nature of projects in Richmond and neighboring areas, adaptability and a keen understanding of regional safety protocols are vital. Safety is paramount, and all installations are conducted following OSHA guidelines and Alessandro Electric's stringent safety protocols.

## Required Experience & Skills

We are seeking candidates with a minimum of 3-5 years of experience installing and maintaining fire alarm systems in commercial settings. A strong understanding of NFPA codes and California fire safety regulations is essential. Proficiency with tools and software used for fire alarm programming and diagnostics is necessary, along with the ability to work at heights and in confined spaces.

Essential certifications include NICET Level II or higher in Fire Alarm Systems, along with a valid California Fire/Life Safety Technician Certification. Technical knowledge should cover the latest advancements in fire alarm technology, including IP-based systems and wireless alarms.

## Tools & Equipment

Daily tools used by our Fire Alarm Installers include multimeters, wire strippers, conduit benders, and cable testers. Personal tools such as a reliable set of screwdrivers, pliers, and a cordless drill are required. Alessandro Electric provides specialized equipment, including laptops loaded with fire alarm programming software and PPE for all team members.

## Physical Requirements

Fire Alarm Installers must be able to lift up to 50 pounds regularly and work in various conditions, including outdoor sites and confined spaces. Safety gear, such as hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots, is mandatory to ensure a secure working environment.

We support ongoing education and encourage our team members to pursue additional certifications such as NICET Level III and IV. Career advancement is a core part of our company culture, with clear pathways to roles such as lead installer and project manager.
