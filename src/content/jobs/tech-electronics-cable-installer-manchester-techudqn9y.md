Hey there! We're Tech Electronics, and we're on the hunt for a Cable Installer to join our team right here in Manchester, NH. If you're in the neighborhood, you might know us – we're just a stone's throw from Nashua, Concord, and Londonderry. We're all about making sure our mission-critical facilities run smoothly with tip-top data center infrastructure. So, if you've got a knack for structured cabling, fiber optics, and cooling separation, we think you'll fit right in.

## Key Responsibilities

So, what will you be doing? Well, you'll be designing and installing structured cabling systems for data centers and enterprise networks. You'll also dive into high-density fiber optic cable installations and certify those systems with advanced test equipment. Cable management in network rooms? You've got it. You'll also terminate and test high-speed copper and fiber connections while keeping our testing documentation and warranties up-to-date.

Plus, you'll coordinate pathway installation with other trades and manage data center hot aisle/cold aisle separation. Installing overhead cable tray and ladder rack systems will be part of your gig, and you'll maintain those clean room protocols for sensitive environments.

Here in Manchester, you'll also get involved with local projects that might require off-hours work—sometimes in active data centers. And, of course, New Hampshire's got its own set of requirements, so you'll be staying updated on those, too.

## Required Qualifications

To be part of our team, you'll need a BICSI Installer 1 certification, and while Installer 2 is preferred, it's not a deal-breaker. You've got to have some solid experience with fiber optic installation and testing, and be a whiz with multiple certification testers. Understanding data center design principles and cable management systems is key. Plus, you'll need to read and create cable installation drawings like a pro and know clean room procedures.

We’re looking for folks with 1-5 years of experience in Voice Data work, particularly in a commercial setting. If you're familiar with the local tech scene around Manchester or have worked on projects in the area, that's a big plus. And if you've got a knack for navigating New Hampshire's specific industry rules, even better!

## Compensation & Benefits

Now, let's talk about what you'll get. We offer a competitive salary ranging from $22.39 to $30.62 per hour, depending on what you bring to the table. We've got comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, so your health is in good hands. Plus, you'll get paid time off and holidays to recharge. We're big on career advancement opportunities and provide ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If this sounds like your kind of role, we’d love to hear from you! Join us at Tech Electronics, and let's make some magic happen in Manchester.
