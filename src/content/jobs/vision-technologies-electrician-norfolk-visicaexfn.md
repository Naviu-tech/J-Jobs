As a Commercial Electrician, you will be working in dynamic environments, conducting electrical installations, maintenance, and upgrades. Your responsibilities will include understanding and managing power distribution systems, implementing advanced lighting controls, and troubleshooting complex electrical issues. You will play a crucial role in planning and executing electrical installations, ensuring quality assurance, and mentoring apprentices, all while maintaining meticulous documentation and coordinating with construction teams.
