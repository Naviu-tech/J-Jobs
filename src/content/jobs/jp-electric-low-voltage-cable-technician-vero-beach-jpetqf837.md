## What You'll Do as a Low Voltage Cable Technician

As a Low Voltage Cable Technician at JP Electric, you'll be an essential part of our team, contributing to multi-year projects in Vero Beach, FL, and surrounding areas such as Sebastian, Fort Pierce, and Palm Bay. Your role will be hands-on, involving the installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of low voltage cabling systems that support voice, data, and video networks. You'll work on projects that are crucial to both residential and commercial developments, ensuring that each setup meets our high standards of quality and efficiency.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Low Voltage Cable Technician

Your day-to-day responsibilities will include installing, terminating, and testing low voltage cabling systems, including fiber optics and Ethernet cables. You'll assist in setting up structured cabling systems, learning to read and interpret blueprints and network schematics under the guidance of senior technicians. Routine maintenance and troubleshooting will be part of your tasks, ensuring that all systems are functioning optimally. Safety is a priority, so you'll follow strict guidelines and comply with local building codes. Keeping work areas organized, maintaining an inventory of tools and materials, and collaborating with team members to ensure timely project completion are also part of your daily routine. You'll often find yourself performing activities such as labeling cables for easy identification, conducting quality checks to ensure installations meet specifications, and coordinating with other trades on-site to streamline project workflow.

## What You Need to Be a Low Voltage Cable Technician

To succeed in this role, you'll need a basic understanding of cabling systems and network components. Proficiency in using hand and power tools safely is essential, along with strong attention to detail and problem-solving skills. The job requires physical stamina, as you'll be lifting heavy objects, climbing ladders, and working in confined spaces. A willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies and industry standards is crucial. We require a high school diploma or equivalent, and technical certifications in cabling or networking are a plus. Ideally, you should have 2+ years of experience in the field, along with a valid driver's license and reliable transportation. Hands-on abilities are key, so skills like cable pulling, terminating, and testing are must-haves.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $22.05-$25.76 per hour, depending on your experience. At JP Electric, you'll find opportunities for career advancement and ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the forefront of the industry. Our benefits package includes health insurance, paid time off, and retirement savings plans, ensuring you have the support you need both professionally and personally. Training opportunities are abundant, allowing you to grow your skills and knowledge continuously, making this not just a job, but a long-term career path.
