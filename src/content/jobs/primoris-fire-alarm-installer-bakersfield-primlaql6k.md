## The Fire Alarm Installer Position

As a Fire Alarm Installer with Primoris, you will be an integral part of our expert team, working on a variety of projects that challenge and enhance your skills. Your day-to-day responsibilities will involve installing, testing, and maintaining fire alarm systems, ensuring they function seamlessly within commercial and industrial environments.

## Core Fire Alarm Installer Responsibilities

Your primary responsibilities will include the installation, testing, and maintenance of fire alarm systems, such as control panels, pull stations, and notification devices. You will conduct comprehensive inspections to ensure compliance with California fire codes and NFPA standards, troubleshooting and repairing any faults to guarantee system reliability. Collaborating with contractors and building managers, you will plan and execute installations efficiently in both new and existing structures. Advanced technical duties include configuring fire alarm systems to integrate with other safety equipment like sprinklers and emergency lighting, ensuring seamless operation. Additionally, you will maintain detailed service logs and provide necessary documentation for system approvals and inspections. Projects in the Bakersfield area often involve coordination with local authorities and adapting to regional safety protocols.
