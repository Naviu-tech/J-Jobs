Join us at Teleco in Austin, TX, where we're looking for a passionate Fire Alarm Installer to be part of our team. If you're excited about working on commercial new construction projects and have a knack for understanding fire alarm systems, you might just be the perfect fit for us. You'll be installing everything from control panels to notification appliances, ensuring safety and reliability in every project. We're involved in projects throughout the Austin area, including nearby cities like Round Rock and Cedar Park. Get ready to make a difference in the heart of Texas!

## Key Responsibilities
As part of our team, you'll be installing fire alarm control panels and devices, pulling and terminating fire alarm cables, and mounting notification appliances and initiation devices. You'll also assist with system programming and testing, maintaining detailed point-to-point wiring documentation. Your role involves coordinating with other trades for device placement, performing pre-wire and trim-out phases, installing conduit and cable pathways, and troubleshooting system wiring issues. Plus, you’ll maintain proper color coding and labeling, and assist with final testing and inspections. In Austin, you'll also be involved in the exciting new development at The Domain, a major commercial project. You’ll need to be familiar with regional requirements for Texas and be ready to adapt to local building codes.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with experience in commercial fire alarm systems. You should be comfortable reading blueprints, and have a solid understanding of NFPA 72 requirements, fire alarm circuit types, and basic programming. You'll need to use multimeters and testing equipment with ease, have a keen eye for detail in documentation, and understand voltage drop calculations. Good communication skills are essential for coordinating with others. Ideally, you have 1-3 years of experience in fire alarm work in a commercial setting. In Austin, familiarity with local electrical codes and experience working on large-scale projects like those in the downtown area will be beneficial.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary range from $24.63 to $31.98 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll also enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in career advancement, providing ongoing training and certifications to help you grow with us.
