As an Electrician Helper at Prime Partners, your role is pivotal to the success of our ongoing projects in Warwick, RI, and surrounding areas like East Greenwich, West Warwick, and Cranston. You'll be a crucial part of our team, working closely with experienced electricians to support the installation and maintenance of electrical systems in both residential and light commercial settings. This is a hands-on position where you'll learn and grow in the electrical trade, all while contributing to real-world projects. 

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician Helper

In your day-to-day tasks, you'll assist electricians with installing and maintaining electrical systems. This means carrying materials, tools, and equipment to various work areas, ensuring that our job sites are organized and clean. You'll help pull wires and cables through conduits and walls, always under the supervision of a licensed electrician. Supporting the installation of lighting fixtures, outlets, and switchgear will be a key part of your role. You'll also perform basic tasks like drilling holes, mounting boxes, and labeling wires.

Additionally, you'll follow instructions to prepare tools and materials needed for each task, learning to identify electrical components and read basic diagrams to assist in system assembly. A typical day might also include tasks such as measuring and cutting wire lengths, assisting with troubleshooting electrical issues, and learning how to safely operate power tools.

You'll need to be physically able to lift and carry heavy materials, work on ladders, and perform repetitive tasks. Attention to detail and the ability to follow instructions precisely are crucial. A strong work ethic and reliability are key in our fast-paced construction environment.

We're looking for individuals with 0-2 years of experience as an Electrician Helper. Must-have skills include basic electrical knowledge, hands-on abilities, and a proactive attitude towards learning and development.
