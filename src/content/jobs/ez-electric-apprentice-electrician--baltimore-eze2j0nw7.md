## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician at EZ Electric, you'll be diving into the heart of exciting multi-year projects in Baltimore, MD, and its neighboring cities such as Towson, Ellicott City, and Columbia. Your role is crucial in supporting our mission to lead innovative electrical solutions. Day-to-day, you'll be immersed in the practical aspects of electrical work, gaining hands-on experience while contributing to the installation of cutting-edge technology. You'll work alongside experienced electricians, learning the ropes and applying your skills to real-world situations.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

Your daily responsibilities will include supporting the installation of rooftop solar arrays, battery systems, and EV chargers on commercial properties. You'll assist in running and securing conduit for DC wiring from solar modules to inverters, ensuring efficient and safe energy flow. Basic wiring tasks, such as terminating PV modules and connecting battery storage systems, will become second nature as you develop your skills. Under supervision, you'll learn to test and troubleshoot solar inverters and monitoring systems, becoming proficient in identifying and resolving issues.

Material preparation will be a key part of your role. You'll coordinate the pre-assembly of racking systems, ensuring everything is ready for installation. Keeping tools organized and following safety procedures for rooftop work, including the use of fall protection equipment, will be essential. Additionally, you'll engage in activities like maintaining a clean work environment and assisting in the inventory management of electrical components.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To thrive as an Apprentice Electrician at EZ Electric, you'll need a solid understanding of basic electrical principles, particularly DC power systems. A willingness to work outdoors on rooftops in varying weather conditions is essential. You'll be expected to follow technical instructions meticulously for assembling and wiring renewable energy systems. Strong organizational skills will aid you in material handling and job site preparation. Proficiency with hand tools and basic testing equipment is a must, as is a keen eye for detail and safety.

We're looking for candidates with 1-4 years of experience in the field as an Apprentice Electrician. Hands-on abilities are crucial, and you should be comfortable working in a dynamic environment where practical skills are put to the test daily.

## Compensation
