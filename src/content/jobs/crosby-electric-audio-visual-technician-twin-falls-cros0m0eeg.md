Welcome to the team at Crosby Electric in Twin Falls, ID! We're on the hunt for a talented Audio Visual Technician to join us in making technology magic happen. Nestled in a picturesque area, Twin Falls is surrounded by beautiful neighboring cities like Jerome, Kimberly, and Filer. If you've got a passion for AV systems and love a good challenge, keep reading. 

## Qualifications

We’re looking for someone who truly gets audio and video systems. You should have a solid understanding of control interfaces and digital signal processing. Experience with Crestron or Extron systems, video distribution, and audio reinforcement is a must. Plus, we need someone who can build racks like a pro and knows their way around display technologies and conferencing systems. 

An AVIXA CTS certification is preferred, but what's really required is a lift certification and OSHA-10. This is a customer-facing role, so we need someone with top-notch communication skills and a professional appearance. You should be ready for some evening and weekend work when we’re commissioning systems. 

If you have 1-4 years of experience in commercial Audio Visual work, you might be just who we’re looking for!

## Key Responsibilities

Your day-to-day will include installing AV equipment and terminating AV cables. You'll configure basic systems and keep all our documentation in check. You'll also assist with system testing, ensuring everything runs smoothly for our clients.

## Compensation & Benefits

We believe in taking care of our team, so here’s what you can expect:

- Salary Range: $24.31-$32.36 per hour
- A comprehensive benefits package
- Plenty of opportunities for career advancement
- Ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game

If you’re ready to bring your AV expertise to a dynamic team and help us deliver top-quality solutions, we’d love to hear from you!
