## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

Welcome to Teleco's multi-year project in San Pedro, CA, where we're looking for skilled Journeyman Electricians to join our team. As a Journeyman Electrician, you'll play a critical role in transforming commercial properties into energy-efficient powerhouses. Your day-to-day will revolve around installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting renewable energy systems. Our projects not only span across San Pedro but also extend to neighboring cities such as Long Beach, Torrance, and Carson, offering a variety of work environments and challenges. Your expertise will be pivotal in ensuring our systems operate at peak performance and adhere to local regulations.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician on our team, your primary focus will be on renewable energy. You'll install, maintain, and troubleshoot solar panels, energy storage systems, and inverters for commercial properties. A significant part of your day will include routing and installing conduit (EMT and rigid) and wiring for high-voltage DC and AC systems. You'll perform system testing and commissioning for solar arrays, ensuring optimal energy output and compliance with local codes.

Collaboration is key, as you'll work alongside engineers and project managers to design and implement energy-efficient electrical solutions. Your role will also include installing and maintaining battery energy storage systems (BESS) and integrating them with building power systems. Conducting preventive maintenance on renewable energy equipment is a daily task, ensuring proper grounding and replacing faulty components when necessary.

Supervising apprentices is another important responsibility, guiding them to adhere to safety standards and proper installation techniques. Moreover, you'll prepare detailed reports on system performance and maintenance activities, providing valuable insights for project improvements. Typical daily activities might also include troubleshooting electrical faults, conducting safety inspections, and coordinating with other trades to ensure seamless project execution.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To thrive in this role, you must possess a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations. Extensive knowledge of the NEC and renewable energy codes, including solar and battery storage regulations, is crucial. Your hands-on experience with solar panel installations, inverters, and high-voltage DC systems will set you apart.

Proficiency with diagnostic tools like multimeters and megohmmeters is essential, as is the ability to read and interpret blueprints, electrical schematics, and energy system diagrams. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail are necessary for troubleshooting and optimizing systems. With a minimum of 4+ years in the field as a Journeyman Electrician, you'll have the hands-on abilities needed to excel in this role.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $31.74-$36.43 per hour, depending on experience. At Teleco, we believe in investing in our team, providing career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp and up-to-date.
