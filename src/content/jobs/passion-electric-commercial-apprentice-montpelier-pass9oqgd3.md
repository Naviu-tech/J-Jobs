Join us at Passion Electric in Montpelier, VT, where we're looking for a Commercial Apprentice to dive into the world of commercial electrical installations. Nestled in the charming city of Montpelier, with easy access to surrounding areas like Barre, Waterbury, and Northfield, you'll be part of a vibrant community while learning the ins and outs of commercial electrical work. If you’re eager to learn, ready to roll up your sleeves, and excited about contributing to projects that make a difference, this could be the perfect opportunity for you!

## Key Responsibilities

As a Commercial Apprentice, you'll be right there in the action, helping with the installation of commercial electrical systems like power distribution, lighting controls, and fire alarm systems. You’ll learn to bend and install conduit, pull and terminate wires, and support panel installations. You'll also get hands-on experience with lighting fixture installations and basic building automation systems. Plus, you'll help test emergency lighting and keep track of materials and site organization. Documenting daily work progress and assisting with blueprint reading and layout will also be part of your routine. In the Montpelier area, expect to support projects that might include working on historic buildings, which will give you unique experience with Vermont’s specific building codes and regulations.

## Required Qualifications

We're looking for someone with a high school diploma or GED and strong math skills. You need to be enrolled in a state-approved electrical apprenticeship program and have a basic understanding of electrical theory. If you've got experience reading blueprints and construction drawings, that's a plus! You should be comfortable with hand and power tools, have a valid driver’s license with a clean record, and be able to lift over 50 pounds regularly. Good communication skills are essential for coordinating on-site tasks. Basic computer skills for documentation and a willingness to attend required training classes round out what we’re looking for. Specific to Montpelier, familiarity with Vermont’s unique environmental and energy conservation standards will be beneficial.

## Compensation & Benefits

At Passion Electric, we offer a competitive salary range of $21.24 to $26.83 per hour, depending on your experience. You’ll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We’re all about helping you grow, so there are plenty of opportunities for career advancement and ongoing training and certifications.
