At Passion Electric, we're all about powering up the future, and we'd love for you to join our team as an Industrial Apprentice Electrician in the vibrant city of Ann Arbor, MI. Nestled near the bustling cities of Ypsilanti and Saline, Ann Arbor offers a perfect mix of innovation and community spirit. We're on the lookout for someone who's as passionate about electrical systems as we are, especially in the world of automated manufacturing.

## Key Responsibilities
As part of our team, you'll dive into installing and terminating 480V 3-phase power distribution systems and showcase your skills with precise conduit bending for complex industrial applications. You'll assist with VFD and motor control installations and conduct preventive maintenance on manufacturing equipment. Testing is key, so you'll use digital multimeters and meggars to keep things running smoothly. Documentation is crucial, so maintaining detailed maintenance logs is part of the gig. You'll also help with PLC cabinet assembly and follow confined space and elevated work procedures. Plus, you'll support production equipment installations and occasionally assist with regional projects like the Ann Arbor Art Fair and other local events.

## Required Qualifications
To rock this role, you'll need your OSHA-30 certification and the ability to read and interpret industrial electrical blueprints and P&IDs. You'll bring demonstrated knowledge of motor control circuits and experience with conduit bending machines up to 2". Proficiency with digital testing equipment and strong mathematical skills for load calculations are also essential. You should be comfy using hand and power tools safely and have a solid understanding of industrial network infrastructure. We're looking for 1-3 years of experience in an industrial setting, and a keen awareness of Ann Arbor's local electrical codes would be a big plus. Familiarity with the energy-efficient practices popular in Michigan is also beneficial.

## Compensation & Benefits
We're offering a competitive salary range of $25.02-$32.50 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll have access to comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in helping you grow, so there are plenty of career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

We're excited to see how you can light up the future with us at Passion Electric!
