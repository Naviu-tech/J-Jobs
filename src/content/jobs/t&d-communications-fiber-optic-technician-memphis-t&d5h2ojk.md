Join us at T&D Communications in Memphis, TN, where we're looking for a Fiber Optic Technician to become a key player in our team. We know that fiber optic systems can be complex, but that's where you come in! You'll help us create top-notch fiber networks, ensuring our clients in Memphis and surrounding areas like Bartlett, Germantown, and Collierville, stay connected and satisfied. 

## Key Responsibilities

You'll be at the heart of designing and implementing cutting-edge fiber optic networks. From fusion splicing to testing and certifying fiber installations, you'll do it all. Keeping meticulous splice documentation and installing fiber distribution systems? That's your jam! Configuring DWDM systems, performing OTDR testing, and setting up fiber management systems will be part of your daily routine. And let's not forget about maintaining a clean work environment and responding to emergencies. You'll also train junior technicians, passing on your knowledge and expertise. In Memphis, you'll tackle unique challenges, like coordinating with local regulations and working on an exciting large-scale projectâ€”expanding the downtown fiber network. 

## Required Qualifications

We're looking for someone with an FOA certification and solid experience in fusion splicing. You've got proven expertise with OTDR testing and a knack for fiber management systems. Your knowledge of fiber types and certification in multiple splice platforms will set you apart. Troubleshooting is second nature to you, and you're skilled in documentation systems and emergency responses. Ideally, you have 2-5 years of experience in commercial fiber work. Specific to Memphis, familiarity with local telecom regulations and infrastructure is a plus, along with experience in high-density urban environments.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary range from $34.13 to $48.95 per hour, based on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays to recharge. We believe in career advancement and will provide ongoing training and certifications to help you grow. 

If you're ready to make a difference and take on an exciting role in the Memphis area, we can't wait to hear from you!
