As part of the Primoris family, our Journeyman Electricians are equipped with the resources and support needed to excel in their roles and drive success across the board.

## The Journeyman Electrician Position

Joining our team as a Journeyman Electrician means stepping into a dynamic and rewarding role where no two days are the same. You'll engage with a variety of tasks, from installing intricate electrical systems to maintaining existing structures in high-demand environments. Our projects span across multiple sectors, including healthcare, commercial, and industrial, offering a challenging yet fulfilling work experience. You'll report to a seasoned Master Electrician, working alongside a collaborative team of skilled professionals. Primoris provides ample growth opportunities, with paths to advance into supervisory roles or specialize in areas like renewable energy or advanced automation systems.

## Core Journeyman Electrician Responsibilities

As a Journeyman Electrician at Primoris, you will be entrusted with installing and maintaining sophisticated electrical systems, especially in new hospital construction projects. This includes wiring patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units with precision. You'll be tasked with routing, bending, and installing conduit (EMT, rigid) to support high-density wiring needs for medical-grade equipment and ensuring all systems are properly grounded and bonded per NEC and hospital-specific codes. Collaboration with engineers and medical equipment specialists will be crucial to meet design specifications and safety standards. Your role will also involve conducting load calculations, installing service equipment, emergency power systems, and backup generators. Additionally, you will supervise apprentices, ensuring safety protocols are followed, and quality workmanship is delivered. Advanced duties include integrating smart technology systems, managing power distribution networks, and overseeing the installation of renewable energy solutions like solar panels. Our projects' regional specifics demand adaptability and an understanding of local regulations and standards. Safety is paramount, requiring strict adherence to OSHA guidelines and Primoris's own comprehensive safety protocols.

## Required Experience & Skills

Candidates must possess a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations, alongside extensive knowledge of NEC and healthcare-specific electrical standards. A minimum of 5 years of experience as a Journeyman Electrician is required, with a proven track record in working with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits. Mastery in reading and interpreting complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals is essential. We require proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters, coupled with strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with diverse teams in high-pressure environments. Essential certifications include OSHA 30, CPR/AED, and specialized training in hospital-grade electrical systems.

## Tools & Equipment

Our Journeyman Electricians utilize a range of tools daily, including conduit benders, wire strippers, crimpers, and voltage testers. Personal tools such as pliers, screwdrivers, and drills are required, while Primoris provides advanced equipment like hydraulic benders and cable pullers. We ensure our electricians are equipped with the latest technology to enhance efficiency and precision in their work.

## Physical Requirements

The role of a Journeyman Electrician involves lifting up to 50 pounds regularly and working in various conditions, including confined spaces and at heights. Safety gear such as hard hats, safety glasses, gloves, and steel-toed boots is mandatory to ensure a safe working environment for all team members.
