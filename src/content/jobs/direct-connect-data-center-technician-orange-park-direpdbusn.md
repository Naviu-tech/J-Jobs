Join our team at Direct Connect in Orange Park, FL as a Data Center Technician, where you'll play a key role in managing our critical facility operations. We're a stone's throw from the bustling cities of Jacksonville, Middleburg, and St. Augustine, so there's always something exciting happening nearby. You'll be diving into the heart of our data center infrastructure, ensuring everything runs smoothly from power and cooling to our sophisticated monitoring systems. We're looking for someone with a knack for server deployment and a passion for maintaining top-notch documentation. If you're ready to be part of a dynamic team that values expertise and innovation, we'd love to meet you!

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be the go-to person for keeping our critical data center infrastructure in tip-top shape. This means handling server installations and decommissions, managing our cable plant documentation, and implementing hot/cold aisle containment. You'll also coordinate maintenance windows, perform power circuit installations, and keep an eye on our environmental controls. We need someone who can execute change management procedures, manage equipment lifecycle, and perform network hardware installations. You'll maintain security protocols and might even find yourself working on an exciting new project in the Orange Park area, like the upcoming Data Integration Hub. Plus, there are always regional requirements to consider, such as Florida's hurricane preparedness protocols.

## Required Qualifications
We prefer candidates with a BICSI Data Center Technician certification and solid experience in critical infrastructure management. You'll need to be skilled at dressing and terminating cables and be comfortable using DCIM systems. Strong documentation skills are a must, and you'll need to pass a clean background check. We're looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a commercial data center setting. Specific to Orange Park, familiarity with local building codes and environmental regulations will set you apart.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive hourly wage between $30.42 and $37.79, depending on your experience. Our benefits package includes comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, as well as paid time off and holidays. You'll also find plenty of career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp.
