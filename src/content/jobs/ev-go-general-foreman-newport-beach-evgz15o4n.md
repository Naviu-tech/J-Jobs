## What You'll Do as a General Foreman

As a General Foreman at EV GO, you will play a critical role in our ongoing efforts to build state-of-the-art electric vehicle (EV) charging stations throughout Newport Beach, CA, and neighboring areas such as Costa Mesa, Irvine, and Huntington Beach. This multi-year project is pivotal in expanding the infrastructure for EVs, and your leadership will ensure that each site is constructed efficiently and to the highest standards. Your work will be hands-on and dynamic, reflecting the fast-paced nature of the construction environment. As a General Foreman, you will be the backbone of our operations, ensuring everything runs smoothly from start to finish.

## Your Daily Tasks as a General Foreman

In your role, you will oversee and manage the civil scope of work for medium to large-scale electrical projects, which primarily involve EV charging station installations. You will supervise multiple crews tasked with activities such as excavation, backfilling, rebar installation, concrete pouring, bollard installation, and asphalt work. Your expertise will guide the interpretation of project plans, blueprints, and schematics, ensuring compliance with design specifications and California Building Code standards.

Daily coordination with project managers, subcontractors, and other teams will be essential. You will ensure work is executed on time, within budget, and meets quality expectations. Conducting milestone inspections and verifying adherence to safety standards will be part of your routine, as will implementing corrective actions when necessary. Maintaining daily reports detailing labor hours, resource usage, and project status will be vital for project transparency and accountability.

You'll monitor and enforce compliance with Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (SWIPPs), ensuring environmental conditions like stormwater management and site cleanliness are upheld. Regular toolbox talks and safety meetings will be conducted to maintain a safety-first culture. Ensuring all crew certifications and equipment are up-to-date and compliant with governing standards will also fall under your purview. Additionally, collaborating with project leadership to address scope changes, track additional work, and maintain accurate documentation for contract variations will be key.

Common activities include:
- Conducting on-site assessments to anticipate and address potential challenges.
- Facilitating smooth communication between field crews and office teams.
- Troubleshooting equipment issues to prevent project delays.

## What You Need to Be a General Foreman

To excel in this role, you need a minimum of 8-10 years of experience as a lead project foreman in commercial civil construction. A strong grasp of the California Building Code and OSHA safety standards is essential. You should have a proven track record in leading teams for excavation, concrete, rebar, asphalt, and similar civil tasks. Strong leadership, organizational, and problem-solving skills are a must-have.

Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite and familiarity with construction project management software, such as Site Tracker, will be beneficial. A valid driver's license with a clean record, alongside the ability to maintain coverage on company auto insurance, is required. While not mandatory, OSHA 30-hour and First Aid/CPR certifications are preferred, reflecting your commitment to safety and preparedness.

## Compensation

You'll enjoy a competitive salary range between $66.05 and $81.47 per hour, commensurate with experience. We offer ample career advancement opportunities and support ongoing training and certifications to help you grow professionally. Key benefits include comprehensive health coverage, retirement plans, and a supportive work environment that values your contributions. You'll have access to training opportunities that will keep you at the forefront of industry standards and practices.
