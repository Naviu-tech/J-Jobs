## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

At Granite State Electric, we are committed to empowering the future through renewable energy solutions. As an Apprentice Electrician, you'll be at the forefront of this transformation, working on a multi-year solar and renewable energy project in Miramar, FL, with additional projects extending to nearby cities such as Hollywood, Pembroke Pines, and Hialeah. Your role is essential in supporting the installation and maintenance of cutting-edge solar panels, battery storage systems, and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. You'll gain hands-on experience and grow into a skilled electrician, all while contributing to a greener future.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

Supporting seasoned electricians, you will help install solar panels on rooftops and ground mounts, ensuring each unit is securely affixed and optimally positioned for maximum energy capture. Running conduit and pulling electrical wire will be part of your core tasks, connecting solar inverters to electrical panels to bring renewable energy into homes and businesses. You'll learn to interpret blueprints and layouts, understanding the intricacies of renewable energy projects. Routine inspections and maintenance on installed systems will be a regular part of your job, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Under the guidance of senior technicians, you'll monitor and troubleshoot system components, developing your problem-solving skills. Maintaining a clean and organized work environment is crucial, so you'll be responsible for managing tools and materials efficiently on-site. Additionally, assisting with the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations and participating in team safety meetings are common activities in your daily routine.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To excel in this position, you should have a basic understanding of electrical concepts and a keen interest in renewable energy systems. A willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies in solar, battery, and EV charging is essential. You'll need to be comfortable working outdoors in various weather conditions and at heights, such as on rooftops. Problem-solving skills and attention to detail are crucial, as is the ability to travel between job sites and work extended hours when necessary. Ideally, you should have 1-4 years of experience as an Apprentice Electrician. A high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, with technical coursework in renewable energy being a plus. Hands-on abilities, such as using power tools and basic electrical equipment, are must-haves for this role.

At Granite State Electric, we offer a competitive salary range of $20.11-$23.32 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll have access to career advancement opportunities and ongoing training to enhance your skills and certifications. We believe in investing in our team, providing benefits that include health insurance, paid time off, and retirement savings plans.
