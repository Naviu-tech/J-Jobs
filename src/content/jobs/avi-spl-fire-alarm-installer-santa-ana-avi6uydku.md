## What You'll Do as a Fire Alarm Installer

Welcome to the team at AVI SPL in Santa Ana, CA, where we're committed to ensuring safety and security through top-notch fire alarm system installations. As a Fire Alarm Installer, your role is crucial in protecting lives and property by ensuring our systems are installed correctly and efficiently. Our current projects range from commercial buildings to residential complexes, providing you with diverse and exciting challenges each day. In this role, you'll work closely with a dedicated team, bringing safety measures to life, one installation at a time.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Fire Alarm Installer

As a Fire Alarm Installer, your day starts with reviewing the project plans and layout diagrams to understand the scope of work. You'll be responsible for assisting in the installation of fire alarm systems, which includes pulling and terminating low-voltage wiring and ensuring all connections are secure and correctly labeled. You'll mount devices like smoke detectors and pull stations, following specified layouts to route cables efficiently.

You’ll also engage in basic testing of installed components to verify system functionality. Maintaining a clean and organized job site is essential, so part of your day involves managing tools and materials to ensure a safe working environment. Additionally, you'll collaborate with team members to troubleshoot any issues that arise during installation, ensuring all systems meet the necessary safety standards.

## What You Need to Be a Fire Alarm Installer

To excel as a Fire Alarm Installer, you'll need a solid understanding of basic hand tools, such as drills and cable strippers, and a familiarity with low-voltage wiring. Strong attention to detail is vital, as you'll be following layout diagrams and instructions to ensure accurate installations. You must be physically capable of lifting up to 50 lbs and comfortable working on ladders and in various environments.

While 0-2 years of experience in the field is preferred, we're committed to providing on-the-job training to help you grow. Key skills include the ability to follow instructions and adhere to safety guidelines, along with a proactive approach to problem-solving and teamwork.
