Hey there! Are you ready to kick-start your career as a Commercial Apprentice with Integra Electrical in Independence, MO? We’re on the lookout for someone who’s excited about diving into large-scale construction projects and learning the ins and outs of complete building systems. You’ll be joining us in a vibrant area with opportunities in cities like Blue Springs, Lee’s Summit, and Kansas City. You’ll get to work on some exciting projects, and we can’t wait to tell you more about them!

## Key Responsibilities
As part of our team, you’ll get hands-on experience designing and installing electrical systems, calculating load requirements, and coordinating with BIM teams. You’ll supervise installation crews, manage project materials, and even get to implement cutting-edge lighting control systems. Plus, you’ll be involved in commissioning systems and installing emergency power systems. We’ll need your help coordinating with mechanical trades and programming building automation interfaces. Mentoring junior technicians is also a big part of what you’ll do! Look out for the upcoming Independence Town Center project, where your skills will shine. In Missouri, understanding local codes and safety requirements is a must.

## Required Qualifications
To join us, you’ll need a Journeyman electrical license and some experience with BIM coordination. We’re looking for someone who knows their way around lighting controls and has strong project management skills. Leadership abilities are key, and you should be certified for operating multiple lift types. You’ll need to know your energy codes and be proficient with building automation systems. Safety management skills? A big yes! As this is an Apprentice role, 0-3 years of commercial experience is what we’re after. Being familiar with Independence-specific building codes and regulations will give you an edge.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive pay rate between $19.39 and $26.49 per hour, depending on your experience. You’ll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, plus paid time off and holidays. We’re big on career advancement and offer ongoing training and certifications to help you grow.

If you're ready to light up your career with us, we’d love to hear from you!
