Hey there! Are you ready to jumpstart your career as a Cable Installer with Atek Communications in the vibrant city of Grand Rapids, MI? We’re looking for enthusiastic individuals ready to dive into the world of electrical construction, focusing on commercial projects in and around Grand Rapids, including nearby cities like Wyoming, Kentwood, and Walker. As an entry-level position, you’ll be learning all about electrical installations, from distribution systems to lighting controls, all while working under the guidance of experienced journeymen. If you’re eager to learn and grow, we’d love to have you on board!

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you'll be diving into a wide range of tasks to build your skills. You'll assist with electrical system installations and learn the ins and outs of commercial wiring methods. Supporting power distribution projects, helping with lighting control programming, and installing conduit and cable pathways will be part of your daily activities. You’ll also maintain the material inventory and operate lift equipment under supervision. Plus, there's the chance to assist with fire alarm installations, document your daily work activities, and support panel installation and testing. You'll even get to learn some basics about building automation. In the Grand Rapids area, you'll be working on exciting projects like the new downtown development initiative, which is bringing fresh opportunities to the heart of the city. And let's not forget, you’ll coordinate with other trades to ensure everything runs smoothly. Just a heads up, Michigan requires you to be enrolled in a state-approved apprenticeship program, and a clean background check and drug test are a must.

## Required Qualifications

To join us, you’ll need a high school diploma or GED and should be enrolled in an apprenticeship program. Some basic electrical knowledge will go a long way, and being able to read construction drawings is key. You should be comfortable with hand tools and have a valid driver’s license. The job can be physically demanding, so you should be able to lift heavy materials and be ready for some ladder work. Good communication skills and basic computer proficiency are important, too. We value commitment to ongoing education, so plan on balancing full-time work with your apprenticeship classes. For Voice Data work in a commercial setting, 1-5 years of experience is required. Since you’ll be based in Grand Rapids, familiarity with local electrical codes and regulations is a plus, as well as having reliable transportation for getting around the city.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary ranging from $22.51 to $32.12 per hour, depending on your experience. Along with a solid pay package, you'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. We believe in work-life balance, so you’ll have paid time off and holidays to relax and recharge. We’re committed to your growth, offering career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to help you climb the ladder in your field.

If this sounds like a match for you, we can’t wait to hear from you. Join us at Atek Communications and let’s build something amazing together!
