## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician at Crosby Electric, you will play a pivotal role in our multi-year project in Lexington, KY. We are focused on delivering high-quality electrical installations in high-rise office buildings and large-scale commercial projects. Your expertise will be essential as we expand our efforts to neighboring cities, including Richmond, Georgetown, Nicholasville, and Versailles. Your day-to-day responsibilities will involve hands-on tasks that are crucial to the success of our projects.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

Your daily responsibilities will include installing and maintaining advanced electrical systems. This involves working on high-rise office buildings and large-scale commercial sites in Lexington and the surrounding area. You will perform precise routing, bending, and securing of conduit (EMT, rigid, and PVC) to support complex wiring layouts. Part of your job will also include assembling and installing switchgear, distribution panels, and motor control centers. 

You will need to read and interpret blueprints and specifications to ensure the correct placement of electrical components. Conducting on-site load calculations for lighting and power systems will also be part of your tasks. Additionally, you will supervise apprentices during wiring and panel installations, ensuring adherence to project timelines and safety standards. Troubleshooting and resolving electrical issues in newly installed systems, including power distribution and lighting controls, will be another critical responsibility.

On a typical day, you might also be testing electrical systems to ensure they are functioning properly and making necessary adjustments. Collaborating with other construction professionals to plan and execute project phases is also common in your daily activities.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To be successful in this role, you need to be proficient in advanced conduit bending techniques, including offsets and saddles, and skilled in using hand and power tools for installing electrical systems. A strong ability to read and apply electrical blueprints and technical documentation is essential. Experience in installing and maintaining lighting controls, motor controls, and distribution equipment is a must. 

You will also need to be capable of leading teams and managing job site workflows to meet deadlines. We require at least 5+ years in the field as a Journeyman Electrician. Key skills include problem-solving, attention to detail, and effective communication.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $29.54-$35.53 per hour, depending on experience. Crosby Electric values career growth and offers advancement opportunities. We support our electricians with ongoing training and certifications to help you stay at the forefront of the industry.
