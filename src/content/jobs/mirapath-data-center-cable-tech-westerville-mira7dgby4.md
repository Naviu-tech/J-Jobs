Are you ready to dive into the world of data centers and make things happen at Mirapath in Westerville, OH? We're looking for a Data Center Cable Technician to join our team and work on structured cabling installations. You'll be right in the heart of Westerville, but our projects also take us to the neighboring cities like Columbus and New Albany. If you’ve got a knack for cable management and installation, we’d love to chat with you!

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be the go-to person for installing and dressing Category 6/6A cabling systems, terminating copper and fiber connections, and keeping those server racks looking pristine. You'll also be in charge of installing overhead cable trays, performing cable testing, and documenting your results. Remember, keeping things clean and organized is key, especially in data center environments. In the Westerville area, you'll also get to tackle some exciting projects, including a large-scale data center expansion right here in town. Plus, you'll be expected to adhere to any specific cable routing requirements that Ohio demands.

## Required Qualifications
We'd love it if you have a BICSI Installer 1 certification, but it's not a deal-breaker. What matters most is your experience with structured cabling systems and your proficiency with cable termination techniques. An understanding of testing procedures and cable management best practices is crucial, and you should be comfortable reading network drawings. We're looking for someone with 1-3 years of experience in voice and data work in commercial settings. In Westerville, being familiar with the local electrical codes and having a good sense of the commercial landscape is a bonus.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary ranging from $26.26 to $34.31 per hour, based on your experience. You'll also enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in supporting your career growth, so you'll have plenty of opportunities for advancement and ongoing training, including certifications.

If this sounds like the kind of role you’d thrive in, let's talk! We can’t wait to see what you bring to the team at Mirapath.
