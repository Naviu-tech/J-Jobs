Hey there! We're TR Group, and we're on the lookout for a Data Center Technician to join our growing team in Frisco, TX. If you're someone who gets excited about managing critical facility operations and enjoys the technical ins and outs of server infrastructure, you might be just who we're looking for. Our Frisco location is buzzing with opportunity, and with cities like Plano, McKinney, and Little Elm nearby, there's always something happening in the area. Plus, we've got some exciting projects in the pipeline that we're eager to dive into, and we need your expertise to make them a success.

## Key Responsibilities
In this role, you'll be the go-to person for keeping our data center running smoothly. You'll monitor and maintain our critical infrastructure, ensuring everything from power to cooling systems is in tip-top shape. When it comes to server installations and decommissions, you'll have it covered, and you'll keep our cable plant documentation up to date. Implementing hot/cold aisle containment and coordinating maintenance windows will be part of your routine, as will performing power circuit installations and maintaining our battery backup systems. You'll also keep an eye on environmental controls and manage equipment lifecycles. 

Working in Frisco, you'll have the chance to tackle region-specific challenges and get involved in a large-scale project, like the upcoming Frisco Data Hub expansion. Plus, you'll manage network hardware installations and ensure our security protocols are always followed. We rely on you to execute change management procedures seamlessly and keep our documentation in top form. And because we're in Texas, there's a unique opportunity to engage with local power grid systems and regulations.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with a BICSI Data Center Technician certification, though it's not a deal-breaker if you don't have it yet. More importantly, you should have experience managing critical infrastructure and a knack for dressing and terminating cables. If you're familiar with DCIM systems and have strong documentation skills, that's a big plus. You'll need to pass a clean background check, and with 3-5 years of experience in a commercial data center setting, you'll fit right in. 

Given our Frisco location, experience with Texan regulatory standards and local infrastructure is highly valued. Plus, knowledge of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex's unique data center landscape will set you apart.

## Compensation & Benefits
We believe in rewarding hard work, so you can expect a competitive salary ranging from $31.33 to $39.08 per hour, depending on your experience. We offer comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage to keep you healthy and happy. You'll also enjoy paid time off and holidays to recharge and spend time with family and friends. We’re big on career advancement opportunities, and we provide ongoing training and certifications to help you grow in your role.

If this sounds like the perfect fit for you, we’d love to hear from you. Join us at TR Group and be part of something exciting in the heart of Frisco, TX!
