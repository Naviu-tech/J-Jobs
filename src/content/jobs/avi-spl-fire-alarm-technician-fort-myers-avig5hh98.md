## Your Daily Tasks as a Fire Alarm Technician

### Installation and Setup

Your day begins with a review of layout plans for the day's project. You'll be responsible for installing and wiring fire alarm devices, ensuring they are correctly mounted according to the specified plans. This involves not only installing the devices but also routing and securing low-voltage cabling through ceilings and walls, ensuring a clean and efficient setup.

### System Testing and Troubleshooting

Once installed, your next task is to perform thorough system testing. You will adjust and fine-tune the systems to ensure they are functioning correctly and comply with all site requirements. Troubleshooting any issues is a critical part of your day, as you'll need to quickly identify and resolve problems to ensure the system is operational and reliable.

### Coordination and Documentation

Youâ€™ll work closely with general contractors and other trades to integrate the fire alarm systems seamlessly with other building systems. Documentation is key; you'll maintain detailed records of your installations and repairs, which is crucial for both compliance and future troubleshooting. Additionally, your role may involve providing basic training for end-users, helping them understand how to operate and monitor their fire alarm systems.
