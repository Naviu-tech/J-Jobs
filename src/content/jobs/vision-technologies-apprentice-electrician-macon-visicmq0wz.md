## The Apprentice Electrician Position

Being an Apprentice Electrician at Vision Technologies means embarking on a dynamic and rewarding journey. Your day-to-day responsibilities will encompass a variety of tasks, from assisting licensed electricians with wiring installations to troubleshooting electrical systems. You'll find yourself working in a multitude of environments, whether it's a residential home, a bustling commercial complex, or an expansive industrial site. Our team structure ensures that each Apprentice Electrician is paired with seasoned professionals who provide guidance and mentorship, fostering an environment of continuous learning. As part of our team, there is significant growth potential, with opportunities to advance into roles such as Journeyman Electrician, and eventually, even a Master Electrician, all while contributing to projects that impact the Macon community and beyond.

## Core Apprentice Electrician Responsibilities

As an Apprentice Electrician, your primary responsibilities will include assisting licensed electricians in the installation of residential electrical systems, which involves wiring for outlets, switches, and lighting fixtures. You'll be entrusted with pulling and securing electrical cables through walls, attics, and crawl spaces, as well as setting up and maintaining job site tools and materials. Your role will involve performing basic tasks such as mounting electrical boxes and preparing conduit for wiring, in addition to helping with labeling and organizing wires according to system plans. Maintaining safety practices and a clean job site is crucial, ensuring all tools and debris are properly stored or disposed of. You'll also shadow experienced electricians to learn proper techniques and methods. Advanced technical duties may include: 

- Assisting in the installation of complex lighting control systems.
- Supporting the setup of high-capacity electrical panels and circuit breakers.
- Participating in the testing and troubleshooting of electrical systems using specialized diagnostic tools.
- Engaging in regional projects like solar panel installations or energy-efficient system upgrades.

Safety protocols are paramount, with a focus on adhering to OSHA standards and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.

## Required Experience & Skills

To thrive in this role, you should possess basic knowledge of residential wiring and circuits, along with the ability to handle tools such as pliers and drills. Strong attention to detail, good organizational skills, and reliable transportation to job sites are essential. We require a minimum of 0-2 years of experience as an Apprentice Electrician. Essential certifications include OSHA 10-Hour Construction Safety and Health certification, as well as a valid CPR and First Aid certification. Your technical knowledge should extend to understanding electrical blueprints and schematics, as well as a fundamental grasp of the National Electrical Code (NEC).
