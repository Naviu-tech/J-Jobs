At Granite State Electric, we pride ourselves on providing top-notch electrical services, and we're excited to expand our team with someone passionate about technology and innovation. If you're skilled in structured cabling and enjoy working with a dynamic group of professionals, we want to hear from you!

## Qualifications

We’re on the lookout for a tech-savvy individual with a solid grasp of structured cabling standards, termination techniques, and testing procedures. You should have experience in cable installation and be comfortable using Fluke testing equipment. Proper documentation of your work is essential, as is a good knowledge of TIA/EIA standards, cable management, and labeling conventions.

While a BICSI Installer 1 certification is preferred, what's non-negotiable is your OSHA-10 certification and a valid driver's license. We're looking for someone with 1-5 years of experience in voice/data work within commercial settings. Plus, some local travel between job sites will be necessary, so a bit of adventure is part of the gig!

## Key Responsibilities

- Install voice and data cabling with precision
- Terminate jacks and panels effectively
- Test connections to ensure everything's running smoothly
- Maintain top-tier cable management
- Keep detailed documentation of installations
- Work collaboratively with other trades in commercial environments

## Compensation & Benefits

- **Salary Range:** $22.44-$30.06 per hour
- Enjoy a comprehensive benefits package that covers all your needs
- Look forward to career advancement opportunities
- Benefit from ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp

If you're ready to dive into a new role that challenges you and helps you grow, we’d love to chat! Apply now and let’s make great things happen together at Granite State Electric.
