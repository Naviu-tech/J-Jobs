Hey there! Are you a whiz at installing fire alarm systems, and looking to join a team that values your skills? We’re Direct Connect, and we’re on the hunt for a Fire Alarm Installer in Durham, NC. We focus on commercial new construction projects, not just in Durham, but also in neighboring cities like Chapel Hill and Raleigh. If you’re ready to take on some exciting projects and grow with a company that offers plenty of opportunities, keep reading!

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you’ll be the go-to person for installing fire alarm control panels and devices. You’ll pull and terminate fire alarm cables, mount those crucial notification appliances, and assist with system programming and testing. Maintaining detailed point-to-point wiring documentation is key, as is coordinating with other trades for device placement. You’ll also dive into the pre-wire and trim-out phases, install conduit and cable pathways, troubleshoot system wiring issues, and make sure everything is color-coded and labeled just right. Plus, you'll assist with final testing and inspections.

In the Durham area, you might need to stay up to date with local regulations, and be ready to tackle some unique projects, like the upcoming expansion at the Durham Innovation District. Working on active construction sites is part of the gig, so being comfortable navigating these environments is important.

## Required Qualifications

To join us, you’ll need experience with commercial fire alarm systems and proficiency in reading blueprints. A solid understanding of NFPA 72 requirements and fire alarm circuit types is essential. You should have experience with basic programming and be skilled at using a multimeter and other testing equipment. Attention to detail, especially in documentation, is a must, as is the ability to calculate voltage drops accurately. Communication skills are crucial for coordinating with the team and other trades.

We’re looking for someone with 1-3 years of experience in commercial fire alarm work. Familiarity with North Carolina’s specific codes and regulations would be a huge plus. Since we’re in the Research Triangle area, being comfortable with tech-driven environments is beneficial.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary ranging from $24.65 to $32.67 per hour, depending on your experience. You’ll also enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. We believe in work-life balance, so we offer paid time off and holidays. With us, there are plenty of career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If this sounds like the right fit for you, we’d love to hear from you. Join us at Direct Connect, where your expertise will be valued and your career can thrive!
