### What You'll Do as a Quality Control Technician

As a Quality Control Technician at Burdett Hill, you'll play a crucial role in maintaining the high standards of our construction projects in Waverly, VA, and nearby areas like Wakefield, Dendron, and Sussex. You'll ensure that every component of our electric motor systems meets the necessary specifications and quality requirements. This isn't just about checking boxes; it's about ensuring our work stands up to scrutiny and performs reliably for years to come.

### Your Daily Tasks as a Quality Control Technician

Your day-to-day will involve performing detailed dimensional and visual inspections of disassembled electric motors and their components. You'll assess parts for necessary repairs and ensure that both new and repaired parts align with engineering drawings and specifications. 

You'll conduct in-process surveillance and final inspections, ultimately giving the green light for motors to be released for shipment. Expect to collaborate closely with machinists and repair technicians, making sure that every piece of equipment that leaves our site is up to our quality standards. 

In addition to these core responsibilities, you'll regularly:
- Calibrate and maintain precision measurement tools to ensure accuracy.
- Investigate quality issues and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.
- Participate in team meetings to discuss ongoing quality improvement strategies.

### What You Need to Be a Quality Control Technician

To succeed in this role, you'll need a high school diploma or equivalent and at least three years of experience working with precision measurement tools like micrometers, calipers, and dial indicators. Your ability to safely handle up to 50 pounds and work in physically demanding environments will be crucial. 

Flexibility is key, as the role may require working overtime, weekends, and holidays, depending on project demands. A background as a military mechanical technician is preferred, but not mandatory. 

Essential skills and attributes include:
- Strong attention to detail and a commitment to quality.
- Hands-on experience with inspection processes and documentation.
- Effective communication skills for collaborating with various team members.

### Compensation

You'll be compensated with a competitive hourly rate ranging from $22.47 to $27.16, depending on your experience and expertise. Beyond the paycheck, we offer career advancement opportunities, ensuring that your efforts can lead to greater responsibilities and rewards over time.

We invest in our technicians through ongoing training and certifications, helping you stay at the forefront of industry standards and practices. Plus, you'll enjoy a benefits package that includes health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Joining our team means you're not just taking a job, but building a career with growth potential.
