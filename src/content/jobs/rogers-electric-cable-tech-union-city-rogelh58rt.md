## What You'll Do as a Cable Tech

As a Cable Tech at Rogers Electric in Union City, CA, you will play a crucial role in our ongoing projects by installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting structured cabling systems. Our current projects involve a mix of commercial and industrial settings, requiring a hands-on approach and attention to detail. You'll be the backbone of our network infrastructure, ensuring seamless connectivity for our clients. Day in and day out, you'll be tasked with laying down the foundation of communication networks, making sure data flows smoothly across all channels.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Cable Tech

Your day will start with a briefing on the day's objectives and site-specific tasks. You will install structured cabling systems, including Cat5e, Cat6, and fiber optics, ensuring they meet the highest standards. You'll terminate and test fiber connections using Fluke testing equipment, ensuring optimal performance. As part of your routine, you'll be responsible for installing and dressing network racks to maintain an organized, accessible system layout. Setting up cable tray systems will also be part of your role, requiring precision and adherence to safety protocols. 

Documentation is key, so you'll be expected to create as-built plans that accurately reflect the installations. Leading small project teams will also be a part of your responsibilities, where you'll guide team members through complex tasks and ensure project milestones are met. Additionally, you may find yourself troubleshooting network issues, ensuring that any disruptions are quickly resolved to minimize downtime.

## What You Need to Be a Cable Tech

To thrive in this role, you'll need extensive experience in structured cabling, with a solid track record of at least 3-5 years in the field as a Cable Tech. Proficiency in terminating both fiber and copper cables is essential, as is a thorough understanding of TIA/EIA cabling standards. You should be comfortable reading network blueprints and translating them into practical installations. Organizational skills are crucial, as you'll manage tools and inventory efficiently to keep projects on track.

Must-have skills include a keen eye for detail, the ability to work independently and as part of a team, and strong problem-solving abilities. Your hands-on expertise will be vital in ensuring the quality and reliability of our installations.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary ranging from $24.79 to $31.37 per hour, depending on your experience and skill set. Beyond the paycheck, you'll enjoy paid time off and holidays, giving you a healthy work-life balance.
