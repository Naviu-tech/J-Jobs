Are you a tech-savvy electrician looking to work with luxury home automation? Simple Electric in Knoxville, TN, is on the hunt for a Luxury Home Technology Specialist to join our team. Knoxville, nestled near Maryville, Oak Ridge, and Sevierville, is a vibrant area with a growing market for sophisticated home automation. We pride ourselves on delivering top-notch service in multi-million dollar homes, and we're ready to bring someone onboard who shares our passion and expertise.

## Key Responsibilities
In this role, you'll be at the forefront of installing and programming state-of-the-art home automation systems. You'll integrate lighting controls with voice activation and mobile apps, set up whole-house audio and video systems, and implement automated shade control. Security and access control integration will also be part of your daily tasks. You'll need to install energy monitoring systems and configure home network infrastructure, ensuring everything runs smoothly with backup power systems. Documenting system configurations and user settings is key, as is providing client training on system operation. Plus, you'll maintain detailed service records for our luxury properties.

Specifically for the Knoxville area, you'll be handling installations that require awareness of local electrical codes and regulations. You'll also develop relationships with local vendors and contractors to streamline project processes, and ensure that systems are optimized for regional weather variations, particularly during those humid Tennessee summers.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with a strong technology aptitude and home automation experience. If you're certified in major control systems like Lutron or Control4, that's a big plus. You should have a solid understanding of residential networking and Wi-Fi systems, as well as experience with high-end finishes and materials. Excellent customer service skills and a professional appearance and communication ability are a must. We also require experience with energy management systems, a clean background check, and drug screening. A valid driver's license with a clean record is essential.

For Knoxville, having 1-2 years of experience in Apprentice-level residential work is required. Familiarity with Tennessee's specific building codes and regulations will set you apart. It's also beneficial if you have knowledge of local utility incentives for energy management systems.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary range of $19.16 to $25.12 per hour, depending on your experience. Our benefits package includes comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. You'll also enjoy paid time off and holidays, with career advancement opportunities to keep you climbing the ladder. We believe in ongoing training and certifications to ensure you're always at the top of your game. Join us at Simple Electric, where your skills will shine and your career will grow.
