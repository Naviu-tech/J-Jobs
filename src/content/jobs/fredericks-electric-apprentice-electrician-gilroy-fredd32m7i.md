As an Apprentice Electrician at Fredericks Electric, you'll be joining us on an exciting multi-year project in Gilroy, CA, with additional opportunities in nearby areas such as Hollister, Morgan Hill, and San Martin. Your role is all about getting hands-on experience while supporting the installation of cutting-edge solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations. You'll work closely with experienced electricians and learn the ins and outs of renewable energy systems. It's a role that combines technical learning with practical application, ensuring you build a solid foundation in the electrical field.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Apprentice Electrician

Your day as an Apprentice Electrician will be varied and dynamic. You'll start by assisting in the installation of renewable energy systems, which includes running conduit, pulling wire, and connecting inverters to electrical panels. You'll learn to read and interpret blueprints and layouts specific to solar and battery projects. Routine inspections and maintenance on systems will be a part of your responsibilities to ensure everything is functioning optimally.

You'll also gain experience in monitoring and troubleshooting system components under the guidance of senior technicians. Compliance with local building codes and renewable energy guidelines is crucial, and you'll be expected to uphold these standards.

A willingness to learn about solar, battery, and EV charging technology is essential. You'll need to be comfortable working outdoors in various weather conditions and at heights, such as on rooftops. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail are key. You'll also need to be willing to travel between job sites and occasionally work extended hours. Ideally, you'll have 1-4 years of experience as an Apprentice Electrician. Must-have skills include a hands-on ability to work with power tools, basic knowledge of electrical circuitry, and a proactive approach to learning and safety.
