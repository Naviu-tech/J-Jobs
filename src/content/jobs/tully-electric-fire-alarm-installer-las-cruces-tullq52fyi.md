## What You'll Do as a Fire Alarm Installer

As a Fire Alarm Installer at Tully Electric, you'll be at the forefront of ensuring safety and compliance for our projects in Las Cruces, NM, and the surrounding areas like Mesilla, Anthony, and Sunland Park. Your work will involve the installation of state-of-the-art fire alarm systems in commercial and industrial structures. We're looking for someone who has a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence. This multi-year project will provide you with the opportunity to hone your skills and make a significant impact on the safety of the buildings we work on.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Fire Alarm Installer

### Install and Integrate Fire Alarm Systems

Your main responsibility will be installing fire alarm systems in high-density commercial and industrial buildings. This involves running conduit and pulling fire-rated cables to support the installations. You'll mount and connect various components such as control panels, notification devices, smoke detectors, and heat sensors.

### Conduct System Testing and Coordination

You'll conduct functional testing of fire alarm systems to ensure they meet compliance standards and seamlessly integrate with California building codes, even though we're working in New Mexico. Coordination with HVAC and sprinkler contractors is crucial to integrate the fire alarm systems into the broader building safety networks.

### Maintain and Document Systems

Part of your role will be to repair or replace faulty components to maintain reliability. Accurate documentation of installation details and system configurations will be a critical part of your job for both inspection and customer records. Additionally, you'll engage in typical daily activities such as attending safety briefings, updating project logs, and collaborating with team members to discuss project progress.

## What You Need to Be a Fire Alarm Installer

### Experience and Skills

To thrive in this role, you should have 3-5 years of experience as a Fire Alarm Installer. You'll need expertise in installing and maintaining fire alarm control panels and field devices. Skills in pulling fire-rated wiring and connecting notification devices are essential. Familiarity with testing and troubleshooting tools for fire alarm systems is also necessary.

### Technical and Project Management Abilities

You should have a strong ability to interpret building plans and system schematics for integration. Managing multiple installation projects with tight deadlines will be a regular part of your work, so organizational skills are key.
