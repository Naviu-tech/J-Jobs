This is a hands-on role that requires a strong understanding of data center operations and infrastructure management.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Data Center Technician

### Install and Configure Equipment

Your primary responsibility will be to install server racks and cabinets, ensuring they are properly aligned and anchored for stability. You'll route and secure high-density cabling within these racks, as well as in overhead trays and under-floor systems, ensuring all connections are secure and efficient.

### Manage Power and Cabling Systems

You'll mount and connect power distribution units (PDUs), ensuring a reliable power supply to all equipment. One of your key tasks will be to manage cable pathways for a clean and organized setup, which is crucial for both performance and maintenance.

### Perform Testing and Documentation

Performing basic cable testing and labeling is another part of your routine to maintain accuracy in our data center documentation. This ensures that all systems are running optimally and any issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

### Must-Have Skills

Proficiency with cable testers is essential for diagnosing and resolving connectivity issues. You should have a robust understanding of network configurations and be comfortable following precise documentation protocols to ensure all systems are accurately recorded and maintained.

### Hands-On Abilities

This role demands practical, hands-on abilities, so you must be comfortable with physical tasks, such as lifting equipment and working in confined spaces. Attention to detail and the ability to troubleshoot complex systems are also critical.
