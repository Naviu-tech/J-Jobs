Join us at Advantage Electric in sunny Miami, FL, where we’re looking for a skilled Industrial Electrician to be part of our team. If you're ready to bring your expertise in automation and process control to a vibrant city like Miami, and its neighboring areas like Fort Lauderdale and Hialeah, this might be the perfect opportunity for you. We’re all about creating a motivated team that thrives on solving complex challenges in our cutting-edge manufacturing environment. 

## Key Responsibilities

As part of our team, you'll dive into programming and troubleshooting Allen Bradley and Siemens PLCs. You'll be the go-to for commissioning automated production lines and conducting root cause analysis on any system hiccups. We count on you to implement predictive maintenance programs, using tools like vibration analysis and thermal imaging. Your skills will shine as you design and install complex motor control circuits and manage our electrical spare parts inventory. Training apprentices and coordinating with equipment manufacturers for those tricky repairs are part of your role too. Plus, developing standard operating procedures for maintenance tasks and performing power quality analysis and harmonic mitigation are on your to-do list. Since we're in Miami, you'll also ensure compliance with local electrical codes and possibly get involved in projects related to the bustling port activities and the growing tech industry in the area. 

## Required Qualifications

We’re looking for someone with advanced certification in Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC programming. You should have demonstrated experience with industrial networking protocols like EtherNet/IP and Profibus, and be a pro at VFD programming and troubleshooting. Your proficiency with thermal imaging and vibration analysis equipment is key, and you need to be comfortable with SCADA systems and HMI programming. Leadership skills in a maintenance environment are a must, along with an understanding of IEEE standards for industrial power quality. You should have at least 5+ years of experience working at a Journeyman level in an industrial setting. Given our Miami location, familiarity with the unique energy demands and infrastructure challenges of South Florida is a plus, as is experience with hurricane preparedness and recovery for industrial operations.

## Compensation & Benefits

At Advantage Electric, we offer a competitive salary range of $40.2-$44.49 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We’re all about helping you grow, so there are plenty of career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If you're ready to take the next step in your career and join a dynamic team in the heart of Miami, we can't wait to hear from you!
