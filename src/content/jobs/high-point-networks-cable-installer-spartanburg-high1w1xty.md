## The Cable Installer Position

### A Day in the Life of a High Point Networks Cable Installer

Being a Cable Installer at High Point Networks involves a dynamic and rewarding workflow. Each day, you’ll find yourself immersed in tasks ranging from installing structured cabling systems to testing and troubleshooting network connections. Our projects span a variety of environments including new constructions, retrofits, and high-security facilities.

This position offers substantial growth potential, with opportunities to advance to supervisory roles or specialize in advanced network systems.

## Core Cable Installer Responsibilities

### Mastering the Art of Cable Installation

As a Cable Installer, your primary responsibilities will include installing Cat5e, Cat6, and fiber optic cabling systems with precision and efficiency. You will terminate and test copper and fiber optic cables using cutting-edge tools and testers, ensuring robust network performance. Your expertise will extend to mounting and securing network racks and patch panels, installing cable tray and ladder rack systems, and dressing and bundling cables to meet stringent industry and site-specific standards. You will read and interpret blueprints and cabling diagrams, coordinating closely with construction teams to seamlessly integrate cabling systems with other infrastructure components. Advanced duties include configuring complex network architectures, performing high-level diagnostics on fiber optics, and implementing advanced safety protocols tailored to regional project specifics. 

## Required Experience & Skills
