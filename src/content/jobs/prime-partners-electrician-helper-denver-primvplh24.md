## What You'll Do as an Electrician Helper

Welcome to Prime Partners, where we are committed to excellence in all our construction projects. As an Electrician Helper, you will play a vital role in our multi-year project in Denver, CO, along with additional projects in neighboring cities such as Aurora, Lakewood, and Thornton. Your primary responsibility will be to support our skilled electricians in various tasks that ensure the smooth operation and completion of both residential and light commercial construction projects. This role is perfect for someone eager to dive into the electrical trade, learn the ropes, and contribute to essential operations each day.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician Helper

As an Electrician Helper, your day will be filled with diverse tasks that are essential for project success. You will assist electricians in the installation and maintenance of electrical systems by carrying materials, tools, and equipment to the work areas. Keeping job sites organized and clean is a crucial part of your role. Under skilled supervision, you'll help pull wires and cables through conduits and walls, supporting the installation of lighting fixtures, outlets, and switchgear.

You will perform basic tasks such as drilling holes, mounting boxes, and labeling wires. Preparing the necessary tools and materials for each task will be part of your daily routine. Additionally, youâ€™ll learn to identify electrical components, read basic diagrams, and assist in the assembly of systems. Common daily activities also include checking and restocking supplies, coordinating with team members to ensure efficient workflow, and observing safety protocols at all times.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician Helper

To thrive as an Electrician Helper at Prime Partners, you need a strong willingness to learn electrical trade practices and safety protocols. A foundational understanding of tools used in electrical work, such as drills, saws, and voltage testers, is essential. The role requires physical stamina to lift and carry heavy materials, work on ladders, and perform repetitive tasks.

Attention to detail and the ability to follow instructions precisely will set you apart. A strong work ethic and reliability are crucial in our fast-paced construction environment. While previous experience (0-2 years) as an Electrician Helper is beneficial, we value hands-on abilities and a proactive approach to learning the trade.
