## What You'll Do as a Fire Alarm Installer

As a Fire Alarm Installer at Helix Electric in Torrance, CA, you'll play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and security of our clients through the installation of fire alarm systems. Our current projects span various commercial and residential buildings in the Torrance area, requiring precision and expertise. Day-to-day, you'll be hands-on, working with a dedicated team to install, maintain, and troubleshoot fire alarm systems. You'll be the go-to expert on-site, ensuring that every alarm system meets the highest safety standards and functions flawlessly.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Fire Alarm Installer

In this role, you'll assist in the comprehensive installation of fire alarm systems. Your day will start by pulling and terminating low-voltage wiring, ensuring all connections are secure and compliant with safety standards. You'll mount devices such as smoke detectors and pull stations, carefully following layout diagrams to route cables efficiently and effectively.

Ensuring proper labeling of wires is essential, as it aids in future maintenance and troubleshooting. You'll also perform basic testing of installed components to confirm their functionality. Maintaining a clean job site is a priority, so you'll regularly organize tools and materials to promote a safe working environment.

Additionally, your day might involve troubleshooting existing systems and making repairs as needed, collaborating with other team members to ensure seamless project progress, and conducting site surveys to plan future installations.

## What You Need to Be a Fire Alarm Installer

To thrive in this position, you should have basic knowledge of hand tools like drills and cable strippers and be familiar with low-voltage wiring. A strong attention to detail is crucial, as is the ability to follow detailed instructions and adhere to safety guidelines meticulously. You should be physically capable of lifting up to 50 lbs and comfortable working on ladders and in confined spaces.

Experience isn't a barrier, as 0-2 years in the field as a Fire Alarm Installer is sufficient. However, must-have skills include the ability to read and interpret technical diagrams, strong problem-solving abilities, and effective communication skills to liaise with team members and clients.

## Compensation

At Helix Electric, we value our Fire Alarm Installers and offer a competitive salary range of $20.31-$27.53 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll also enjoy paid time off and holidays, recognizing the importance of work-life balance.
