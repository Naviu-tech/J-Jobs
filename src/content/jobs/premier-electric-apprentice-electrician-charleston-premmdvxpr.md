Start your career as an Apprentice Electrician with Premier Electric in Charleston, SC. This is an exciting opportunity for an individual looking to start their journey in the electrical trade. Although based in Charleston, our work extends to neighboring cities such as North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, and Summerville. Your role will involve learning various aspects of electrical installation and maintenance while assisting our experienced electricians. You will be enrolled in or accepted into an approved apprenticeship program, which includes both on-the-job training and required classroom instruction. 

## Key Responsibilities
As an Apprentice Electrician, you will assist our journeyman electricians with the installation and maintenance of electrical systems. Your duties will include learning to read electrical blueprints and diagrams, assisting with the installation of conduits and raceways, and pulling wire through conduit systems. You will also be involved in device and fixture installation and learn the proper use of hand and power tools. 

Maintaining clean and safe work areas, organizing materials and tools, and assisting with basic troubleshooting will also be part of your day-to-day tasks. You will document the work performed, follow safety protocols, learn electrical code requirements and help with material handling and logistics, and maintain tool inventory. 

Additionally, you will learn proper testing procedures, assist with the preparation and clean-up of work sites, and participate in the installation and maintenance of electrical equipment and systems. 

This role will require you to adhere to the regional requirements of South Carolina and be prepared to work on upcoming apprentice electrician projects in Charleston and surrounding areas.

The ideal candidate for the Apprentice Electrician role will have a high school diploma or equivalent and be enrolled in or accepted into an approved electrical apprenticeship program. You should have basic math skills, the ability to read and follow instructions, and a willingness to learn. 

Reliable transportation, the ability to lift 50+ pounds regularly, comfort working at heights and in confined spaces, and basic computer skills are also necessary. Good communication abilities, a strong work ethic, the ability to work in various weather conditions, a valid driver's license, and the ability to pass a drug test and background check are also required. 

Prior electrical experience is not necessary, but any hands-on experience in construction or other trades is beneficial. A basic understanding of electrical safety and a commitment to following safety protocols is also expected.
