Coordination with the crew is essential for seamless pathway installations and maintaining a clean, organized work environment. Emergency restoration is a critical component of the role, requiring quick response and effective problem-solving. The specialist also plays a mentorship role, training junior technicians to uphold the standards of MMR Group.
