Hey there! We're Kirby Electric, and we're on the lookout for a talented Cable Installer to join our team in the vibrant city of Denver, CO. Nestled in the heart of the Rockies, Denver is surrounded by beautiful places like Boulder, Aurora, and Lakewood. If you’re someone who loves a mix of urban life and outdoor adventures, this could be the perfect spot for you. At Kirby Electric, we're all about ensuring our mission-critical facilities run smoothly, and we need someone like you to help us make that happen.

## Key Responsibilities

As part of our team, you'll get to design and install structured cabling systems for data centers and enterprise networks. You'll handle high-density fiber optic cable installations and certify these systems using advanced test equipment. Proper cable management in network rooms will also be on your plate, along with terminating and testing high-speed copper and fiber connections. Maintaining detailed testing documentation and warranties is key, and you'll coordinate pathway installations with other trades. You'll also tackle data center hot aisle/cold aisle separations and install overhead cable tray and ladder rack systems. Plus, keeping up with clean room protocols for sensitive environments is a must.

In the Denver area, you'll also handle installations in some unique environments, like those found in the tech-forward communities around Boulder. You’ll need to navigate local regulations and ensure compliance with Colorado's specific electrical codes. Occasionally, you may work with local utility companies to coordinate complex installations or upgrades.

## Required Qualifications

We’re looking for someone with a BICSI Installer 1 certification (Installer 2 is a bonus!). You should have experience with fiber optic installation and testing, and be proficient with multiple certification testers. An understanding of data center design principles is crucial, as is experience with cable management systems and pathways. You should know your way around clean room procedures and be able to read and create cable installation drawings. An understanding of network hardware requirements is important too.

You'll need 1-5 years of experience in Voice Data work in a commercial setting. Being in Denver, familiarity with local zoning laws and the ability to navigate the Front Range's unique geographical challenges is a plus. Experience working in high-altitude conditions can also be beneficial.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary range of $22.72 to $30.65 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll also enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, and we make sure you have time to recharge with paid time off and holidays. We believe in helping you grow, so we offer plenty of career advancement opportunities along with ongoing training and certifications.

If this sounds like the right fit for you, we’d love to hear from you. Join us at Kirby Electric and help us power the future, right here in Denver!
