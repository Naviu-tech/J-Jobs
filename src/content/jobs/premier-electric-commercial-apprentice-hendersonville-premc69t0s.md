## About The Role

In the thriving electrical industry, Premier Electric in Hendersonville, TN, is seeking a dedicated Commercial Electrical Apprentice to join our team. This entry-level position is designed for individuals eager to develop their skills in electrical installations and gain hands-on experience under the guidance of licensed electricians. As a Commercial Electrical Apprentice, you will immerse yourself in various commercial projects, ranging from small businesses to large corporate structures, each offering unique learning opportunities.

Your primary responsibilities will involve assisting in the installation and maintenance of electrical systems. You will work closely with experienced electricians to gain practical knowledge in wiring, conduit installation, equipment setup, and other critical electrical tasks. This role requires a basic understanding of electrical systems and a strong commitment to safety protocols. You will be expected to contribute to maintaining a clean and safe work environment, and your physical ability to handle tools and materials in various settings is essential.

Emphasis will be placed on your growth and development through structured learning and attending necessary apprenticeship classes. This position offers an excellent pathway into a rewarding electrical career, with opportunities for advancement and exposure to diverse commercial electrical projects.

## Technical Skills & Certifications

To succeed in this role, a high school diploma or equivalent is required, with enrollment in an accredited apprenticeship program strongly preferred. Candidates should possess a foundational understanding of electrical concepts, including the principles of electricity, electrical currents, and basic circuit design.

Familiarity with the National Electrical Code (NEC) is beneficial, as adherence to these standards is crucial for ensuring safe and compliant installations. You will be expected to develop proficiency in using specific tools and equipment, such as multimeters, conduit benders, wire strippers, and voltage testers.

Certifications that enhance your candidacy include OSHA 10 or 30-hour Construction Safety certification, CPR and First Aid certification, and a willingness to obtain a valid driverâ€™s license. These certifications demonstrate your commitment to safety and professional development.

Key skills include the ability to follow instructions accurately, effective communication, teamwork, attention to detail, and a strong safety awareness. Reliable transportation and punctuality are essential to meet the demands of the job.

## Project Responsibilities

As a Commercial Electrical Apprentice, you will engage in a variety of electrical projects, providing support in installations and upgrades. Typical tasks include assisting with the installation of electrical wiring systems, conduits, panels, and devices, as well as performing equipment checks and maintenance under supervision.

You will learn to interpret and apply information from blueprints, schematics, and technical documents to ensure correct installations. Troubleshooting processes will be taught, where you will develop skills to diagnose and resolve electrical issues effectively.

Safety protocols are paramount in this role. You will be trained to identify potential hazards, use personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly, and comply with all safety regulations and guidelines. Participation in safety briefings and team meetings is mandatory to reinforce these practices.

Supporting the team with material handling and logistics, maintaining a clean and organized worksite, and documenting daily tasks and lessons learned are also part of your responsibilities. This documentation will aid in tracking your progress and identifying areas for further development.

## Career Development

The path from apprentice to journeyman electrician offers clear progression opportunities. With 0-3 years of hands-on electrical experience, you can transition to a journeyman role, where you will take on more complex projects and responsibilities.

Premier Electric supports this progression through available certifications and specialized training programs. You will have access to mentorship opportunities with master electricians who will guide your development and share their expertise.

Career advancement is supported by ongoing training, allowing you to earn additional certifications such as the Journeyman Electrician License or specialized credentials in areas like renewable energy systems or advanced wiring techniques.
