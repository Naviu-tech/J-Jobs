Hey there! Are you an industrial electrician on the lookout for an exciting opportunity? Here at Tech Electronics in Kansas City, KS, we're on the hunt for someone just like you to join our team. Our city's a lively hub with neighboring areas like Overland Park, Olathe, and Independence, which offer a vibrant community and plenty of things to do. We're all about automation and process control, and we need someone who's got the skills and passion to keep us at the top of our game. If you're ready to dive into a role that combines technical expertise and leadership, let's chat!

## Key Responsibilities

You'll be our go-to person for programming and troubleshooting Allen Bradley and Siemens PLCs. You'll also commission automated production lines and get to the bottom of system failures through root cause analysis. We rely on you to implement predictive maintenance programs using techniques like vibration analysis and thermal imaging. Designing and installing complex motor control circuits will be in your wheelhouse, too. Additionally, you'll manage our inventory of electrical spare parts, train apprentices, and coordinate with equipment manufacturers for any tricky repairs. Don't forget, you'll also help develop standard operating procedures for maintenance tasks and perform power quality analysis and harmonic mitigation.

In Kansas City, you might also be involved in supporting local manufacturing initiatives, ensuring compliance with regional safety standards, and participating in community tech events. Plus, understanding local utility regulations for power quality is a big plus!

## Required Qualifications

We're looking for someone with advanced certification in Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC programming. You should have solid experience with industrial networking protocols like EtherNet/IP and Profibus, and be an expert in VFD programming and troubleshooting. Proficiency with thermal imaging and vibration analysis equipment is key, and you should be able to read and create AutoCAD electrical drawings. Experience with SCADA systems and HMI programming is a must, along with proven leadership skills in a maintenance environment. Familiarity with IEEE standards for industrial power quality is necessary, and you'll need at least 5 years of experience in a similar Journeyman role.

In Kansas City, having a connection to local industrial networks and knowledge of Missouri River environmental standards will set you apart!

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary range of $41.58-$45.59 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We're big on career advancement opportunities and provide ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If this sounds like the kind of role you're cut out for, we can't wait to hear from you!
