## What You'll Do as a Warehouse Picker & Packer

As a Warehouse Picker & Packer at Albertsons in San Dimas, you'll play a crucial role in ensuring that our operations run smoothly and efficiently.

Our warehouse thrives on teamwork, precision, and the ability to meet daily targets, making each day both challenging and rewarding.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Warehouse Picker & Packer

### Picking Orders with Precision

Every day, you will use handheld scanners to pick products from our shelves based on specific order specifications. You'll need to navigate the warehouse quickly and efficiently, ensuring each item is the correct product and quantity. Attention to detail is key as you ensure that our customers receive exactly what they ordered.

### Packing with Care and Accuracy

Once items are picked, you'll pack them securely for shipment. This involves using various packing materials and methods to ensure that products arrive safely and in excellent condition. Maintaining high standards of accuracy and quality is essential, as is ensuring that each package is labeled correctly and ready for dispatch.

### Maintaining Order and Cleanliness

You'll also be responsible for keeping your packing station organized and clean. This includes restocking packing supplies, disposing of waste, and ensuring that all equipment is in good working order. A tidy workspace helps us maintain our efficiency and safety standards.

Effective communication with inventory teams is crucial. You'll need to inform them when stock in picking areas is running low so they can replenish it promptly. This ensures that you and your fellow team members can continue fulfilling orders without interruption.

### Key Skills and Abilities

Strong attention to detail is a must-have skill, ensuring accuracy in picking and packing tasks. Familiarity with handheld scanners or warehouse management systems will give you an edge, though training is available. The ability to work efficiently in a team and independently is also crucial.
