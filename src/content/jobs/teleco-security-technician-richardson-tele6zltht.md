Hey there! We're Teleco, and we're on the lookout for a skilled Security Technician to join our team in Richardson, TX. You'll be working with us to handle some exciting projects in and around Richardson, including Plano, Garland, and Carrollton. This role is all about getting hands-on with critical facility cabling, so if you're into structured cabling systems and fiber optics, you might just be the person we're looking for!

## Key Responsibilities

You'll be diving into installing and certifying structured cabling systems and performing fiber optic terminations and testing. We're counting on you to implement top-notch data center cable management and coordinate pathway installations while keeping up with clean room protocols. Operating cable certification equipment and installing overhead cable tray systems will be part of your daily routine. Don't forget to document testing results and warranties! High-density rack cabling and maintaining proper separation in hot and cold aisle environments are also in the mix. Plus, we've got a big project coming up at the Richardson Technology Park, and we'd love for you to be part of it. There might be some regional compliance requirements for Texas to keep in mind, too.

## Required Qualifications

You'll need a BICSI Installer 1 certification for this role. It's important that you have experience with structured cabling systems and are proficient in fiber optic installation. Know your way around cable testing equipment and data center infrastructure? Perfect! Familiarity with TIA standards and technical documentation skills are also essential. We prefer candidates with 1-3 years of experience in security work within a commercial setting. If you've got some experience working in Texas's tech hubs, that's a big plus! 

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary ranging from $30.35 to $37.74 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll also get comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We're all about helping our team grow, so you'll have opportunities for career advancement and ongoing training and certifications.

If this sounds like a fit for you, we'd love to hear from you!
