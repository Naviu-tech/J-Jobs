## Understanding the Role of an Electrician at AVI-SPL

As an Electrician at AVI-SPL in Altamonte Springs, FL, you'll be an integral part of our construction team, working on exciting projects that range from large commercial buildings to intricate installations. Your role is crucial in ensuring that electrical systems are installed safely and efficiently, meeting both the project specifications and local electrical codes. You'll be hands-on every day, applying your skills to bring power and light to our projects.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician

Your day-to-day activities will involve a variety of tasks that require precision and expertise. You'll be responsible for installing commercial electrical systems, which include setting up switchgear, panels, and transformers. Your ability to measure, cut, bend, and install EMT and rigid conduit based on blueprints will be vital. You'll be pulling wires through conduits and terminating them within boxes, ensuring all connections are secure and neatly organized. 

Installing and wiring lighting fixtures, outlets, and power circuits will also be part of your daily responsibilities. You'll need to perform testing and troubleshooting of circuits and electrical components using tools like multimeters to ensure everything functions correctly. Collaboration with other trades is crucial, as you'll work together to plan and complete installations within the project timelines. Keeping your work area organized, clean, and compliant with safety standards is a must.

Additional activities might include interpreting complex blueprints and schematics to determine the best approach for installations, and participating in project meetings to discuss progress and address any challenges. You'll often find yourself solving practical problems on-site to keep the project on track.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician

To thrive in this role, you need a strong proficiency with conduit benders and power tools. An in-depth knowledge of National Electrical Code (NEC) standards is essential, as is the ability to work comfortably on lifts and scaffolding. Strong troubleshooting skills are a must, as you'll frequently encounter issues that require quick and effective solutions. Experience with lighting control systems will set you apart, and having leadership capabilities to mentor apprentices is a valued asset.

We expect our Electricians to have 3-5 years of field experience. Must-have skills include the ability to read and interpret blueprints, excellent hand-eye coordination, and a meticulous approach to detail. Your hands-on abilities, paired with a proactive attitude towards learning and adapting, will ensure your success on our team.

## Compensation and Benefits

At AVI-SPL, we offer a competitive salary range of $32.23 to $39.87 per hour, depending on your experience. We are committed to your career advancement and provide opportunities for ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp and updated with the latest industry trends. Our key benefits include comprehensive health coverage, retirement plans, and paid time off. You'll also have access to continual learning resources to enhance your professional growth, ensuring you're always prepared for the next step in your career.
