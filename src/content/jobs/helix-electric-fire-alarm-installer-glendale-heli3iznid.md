## The Fire Alarm Installer Position

Joining our team as a Fire Alarm Installer means becoming a part of a dynamic and skilled workforce dedicated to safety and quality. On a daily basis, you will be involved in installing, testing, and maintaining fire alarm systems in diverse environments ranging from high-rise commercial buildings to expansive industrial facilities. You will work closely with a team of professionals under the guidance of seasoned supervisors, ensuring that each task is executed to perfection. The potential for growth within Helix Electric is substantial, with opportunities to advance into supervisory roles, project management, or specialized technical positions as you gain experience and demonstrate your capabilities.

## Core Fire Alarm Installer Responsibilities

As a Fire Alarm Installer, your primary responsibilities will include the installation, testing, and maintenance of fire alarm systems, which encompass control panels, pull stations, and notification devices. You will conduct thorough inspections to ensure compliance with California fire code and NFPA standards, troubleshoot and repair any faulty wiring or devices, and ensure system reliability. Collaboration with contractors and building managers will be essential as you plan and execute installations in both new and existing structures. Additionally, you will program fire alarm systems to seamlessly integrate with other safety equipment, such as sprinklers and emergency lighting. Detailed service logs and documentation for system approvals and inspections are crucial components of your role. Advanced technical duties include configuring networked fire alarm systems, utilizing advanced diagnostic tools for system evaluation, and providing training to junior installers. Regional projects may involve large-scale installations in areas like Pasadena and Burbank, where adherence to safety protocols is paramount.

## Required Experience & Skills

To thrive in this role, you should have a minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a Fire Alarm Installer, with a strong background in installing and maintaining fire alarm systems in commercial settings. A deep understanding of NFPA codes and California fire safety regulations is essential, along with proficiency in using tools and software for fire alarm programming and diagnostics. The ability to work at heights and in confined spaces is often required by job sites. Strong organizational skills are necessary for managing multiple projects and meeting deadlines, while effective communication skills are critical for collaboration with team members and clients. Essential certifications include NICET Level II in Fire Alarm Systems and OSHA 10 or 30-hour Construction Safety certification. Technical knowledge in advanced fire alarm systems and integrated safety solutions is highly valued.

The physical demands of a Fire Alarm Installer include the ability to lift up to 50 pounds regularly and work in various conditions, including outdoor environments and non-climate-controlled spaces. Safety gear such as hard hats, gloves, and steel-toed boots are mandatory to ensure your protection on the job site.
