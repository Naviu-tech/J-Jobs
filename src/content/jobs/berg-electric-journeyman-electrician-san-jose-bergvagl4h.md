## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician with Berg Electric, you'll play a crucial role in our ongoing multi-year projects in San Jose, CA, and its neighboring cities, such as Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Milpitas. Your expertise will be pivotal in the construction of new hospitals, where you'll be responsible for installing and maintaining electrical systems critical to healthcare operations. This role is hands-on and dynamic, requiring a balance of technical skill and collaboration.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Installing and Maintaining Complex Electrical Systems

Your primary responsibility will be to install and maintain intricate electrical systems in new hospital construction projects. This includes wiring patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units. You'll need to ensure all systems are properly grounded and bonded, adhering to NEC and hospital-specific regulations.

### Collaboration and Supervision

You'll work closely with engineers and medical equipment specialists to ensure power systems align with design plans and safety standards. Additionally, you'll oversee apprentices, guiding them in safety protocols and ensuring quality workmanship.

### Troubleshooting and Testing

### Certification and Experience

To join our team, you must possess a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations and have over 5 years of experience in the field. Your extensive knowledge of the NEC and healthcare-specific electrical standards is essential.

### Technical Skills

You'll need strong hands-on abilities, including proficiency with diagnostic tools like multimeters and megohmmeters. Your ability to read and interpret complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals will be crucial.

### Communication and Teamwork

Strong communication skills are vital as you'll collaborate with diverse teams in high-pressure environments. Your ability to work effectively with others will ensure project success.

## Compensation
