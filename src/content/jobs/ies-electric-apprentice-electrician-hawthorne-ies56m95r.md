## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician with IES Electric, you'll be diving into the heart of our exciting and innovative projects in Hawthorne, CA. We're leading the charge in renewable energy installations, and you'll play a pivotal role in making these projects come to life. Working alongside experienced electricians and technicians, you'll assist in installing solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations across residential and commercial properties. Your work will extend beyond Hawthorne, covering neighboring cities like Torrance, Inglewood, and El Segundo, ensuring a diverse and dynamic work environment.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician, your days will be filled with hands-on, practical tasks that are fundamental to our projects' success. You'll support the installation of cutting-edge renewable energy systems, helping to run conduit, pull wire, and connect inverters to electrical panels. Learning to interpret system blueprints and layouts will become second nature as you assist with these renewable energy projects.

Routine inspections and maintenance will be a regular part of your job, ensuring that our systems operate at peak efficiency. Under the guidance of senior technicians, you'll monitor and troubleshoot system components, gaining invaluable experience in problem-solving and critical thinking. You'll also ensure all work aligns with local building codes and renewable energy guidelines, maintaining high standards of safety and compliance.

Additionally, you'll help maintain a clean and organized work environment, managing tools and materials effectively on-site. You might find yourself assisting in the installation of lighting systems or learning to work with advanced electrical components. Every day will bring new challenges and learning opportunities.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To thrive in this role, you'll need a solid understanding of basic electrical concepts and a keen interest in renewable energy systems. Your eagerness to learn about solar, battery, and EV charging technology will be crucial. The ability to work outdoors in various weather conditions and at heights, such as on rooftops, is essential. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail will set you apart.

We seek candidates with 1-4 years of experience in the field as an Apprentice Electrician. You must have hands-on abilities, including familiarity with electrical tools and equipment. A high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, and technical coursework in renewable energy is a plus. Flexibility to travel between job sites and work extended hours when necessary is also important.
