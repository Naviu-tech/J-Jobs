As an Assistant Receiving Clerk at States Logistics, based in our bustling Whittier warehouse, you'll play a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless flow of goods into our inventory. You will be the backbone of our receiving operations, working closely with a dynamic team to manage incoming shipments efficiently. Your role is essential in keeping our supply chain moving smoothly and ensuring our warehouse remains organized and operational.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Assistant Receiving Clerk

In your daily routine, you will be responsible for inspecting incoming shipments to verify their accuracy. This involves checking the goods against accompanying paperwork and ensuring they meet our quality standards. You will assist with unloading trucks, which requires both physical stamina and attention to detail to ensure that all items are handled safely and efficiently.

Once the goods are unloaded, you will organize them in designated areas, making sure they are easily accessible for further processing. You will use RF scanners to log inventory into our warehouse management system, ensuring that all data is accurate and up-to-date. Clear communication with supervisors about any damaged or missing items is crucial, as this helps us maintain our high standards.

You will also be tasked with maintaining the cleanliness and orderliness of the receiving dock, which is vital for safety and efficiency. Other common activities include coordinating with delivery drivers, assisting in routine inventory checks, and collaborating with warehouse staff to improve receiving processes.

## What You Need to Be an Assistant Receiving Clerk

To thrive as an Assistant Receiving Clerk, you should have a high school diploma or equivalent. The ability to lift up to 50 pounds and work in a fast-paced environment is essential. While basic computer and inventory tracking skills are preferred, having at least 1+ years of experience in a similar role will significantly benefit your application.

Key skills for success include strong attention to detail, effective communication, and the ability to work collaboratively within a team. Hands-on experience in operating basic warehouse equipment and a proactive approach to problem-solving are also highly valued.
