## What You'll Do as an Electrical Foreman

As an Electrical Foreman at Blink Charging, you'll play a crucial role in expanding our electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Garden Grove, CA, and surrounding areas like Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Westminster. This multi-year project requires hands-on leadership, as you will be responsible for overseeing the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations. Your expertise will ensure that projects meet design specifications, comply with safety standards, and adhere to deadlines. This role is not just about supervision; it's about being an integral part of the field operations team, working hand-in-hand with journeymen and apprentices to bring our vision to life.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrical Foreman

### Lead Field Operations for EV Charging Stations

Your main responsibility will be to lead field operations for the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations. This involves ensuring compliance with project designs, safety standards, and deadlines. You'll oversee the installation of commercial electrical systems, including service panels, transformers, and conduit work, ensuring that all installations meet NEC and California Electric Code standards.

### Manage and Mentor Your Team

A key part of your day will be planning and allocating daily tasks for journeymen and apprentices. You'll ensure efficient crew operations and adherence to safety protocols. As a leader, you'll provide on-site coaching and mentoring for team members, fostering a collaborative and productive work environment.

### Troubleshoot and Resolve Electrical Issues

You'll be the go-to person for troubleshooting and resolving electrical issues. Using tools like multimeters and megohmmeters, you'll conduct diagnostics and implement solutions to keep the project on track. Your ability to quickly resolve issues will be critical in maintaining project momentum.

### Collaborate and Communicate

Collaboration is essential in this role. You'll work closely with project managers, clients, and other trades to resolve field challenges and ensure seamless project execution. Regular communication and coordination with various stakeholders will be part of your daily routine.

### Ensure Safety and Compliance

Safety is paramount. You'll conduct regular safety meetings, enforce stop work authority in the event of violations or unsafe conditions, and ensure the job site is clean and organized. Maintaining daily reports documenting project progress, labor hours, material usage, and any deviations from the plan will also be one of your responsibilities.

## What You Need to Be an Electrical Foreman

### Qualifications and Experience

You'll need an active and valid journeyman electrician certification from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). A minimum of 5 years of experience in commercial electrical work, with at least 2 years in a leadership role, is required. Experience with EV charging station installations is a must, along with extensive knowledge of NEC and California Electric Code.

### Skills and Abilities

Proficiency with conduit bending, wire termination, and troubleshooting electrical systems is essential. Strong leadership and communication skills are necessary to mentor apprentices and manage field teams effectively. A valid driver's license with a clean driving record and the ability to maintain auto insurance coverage is required. OSHA 30-hour certification and First Aid/CPR are preferred, and familiarity with construction management software like Site Tracker is a plus.

## Compensation

- Competitive hourly rate: $48-$58.39 per hour, depending on experience
- Opportunities for career advancement
- Ongoing training and certification programs
- Comprehensive benefits package, including health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off

This position offers not only a competitive salary but also the chance to grow with a company at the forefront of the EV charging industry. With ongoing training and advancement opportunities, you'll be well-equipped to lead our projects to success.
