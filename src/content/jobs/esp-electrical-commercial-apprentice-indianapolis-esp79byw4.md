Hey there! We're ESP Electrical, and we're excited to find a Commercial Construction Apprentice Electrician to join our team here in Indianapolis, IN. Just a stone's throw away from Carmel, Fishers, and Greenwood, you'll be right in the heart of a vibrant and growing area. As an apprentice, you'll dive into the world of commercial electrical installation, focusing on new construction and tenant improvement projects. You'll learn the ropes of power distribution, lighting systems, and life safety, all while soaking up knowledge from seasoned journeyman electricians. If you're passionate about getting hands-on experience and eager to learn, we might just be the perfect fit for each other!

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you'll be getting your hands dirty with plenty of learning opportunities. You'll assist with installing commercial electrical systems, including power distribution, lighting controls, and fire alarm systems. You'll learn conduit bending and installation techniques for EMT and rigid conduit, help with wire pulling and termination in electrical rooms, and support panel installation and circuit identification. Plus, you'll assist with lighting fixture installation and controls programming, learn the basics of building automation systems, help with emergency lighting installation and testing, maintain material inventory, and keep the job site organized. You'll also document daily work progress, operate aerial lifts and scaffolding under supervision, and assist with blueprint reading and layout. Additionally, you'll gain exposure to the specific needs of Indianapolis projects, like accommodating local building codes and ensuring compliance with regional safety standards.

## Required Qualifications

We're looking for someone with a high school diploma or GED who has strong math skills and is already enrolled in a state-approved electrical apprenticeship program. A basic understanding of electrical theory and the ability to read basic blueprints and construction drawings are key. You'll need to be proficient with hand tools and power tools, hold a valid driver's license with a clean record, and be able to lift 50+ pounds regularly. Good communication skills for job site coordination and basic computer skills for documentation are also important. Ideally, you have 0-3 years of experience in a commercial setting. In Indianapolis, you'll need to be familiar with local municipal regulations and have the flexibility to attend required training classes.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary range of $21.65-$27.32 per hour, depending on your experience. Alongside that, we provide comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. You'll have plenty of opportunities for career advancement, and we support ongoing training and certifications to help you grow in your role.

If you're ready to kickstart your career in commercial electrical work and be part of a team that's dedicated to your growth, we'd love to hear from you!
