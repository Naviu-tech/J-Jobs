Our current projects involve intricate security systems installations in both commercial and residential settings. You'll be hands-on every day, working to install and maintain cutting-edge security technology, ensuring everything operates smoothly and securely. 

## Your Daily Tasks as a Security Tech

As a Security Tech, your day-to-day tasks will be varied and engaging. You'll start by installing and configuring IP cameras and access control systems, ensuring each piece is perfectly in place.

Familiarity with cable termination tools and a solid understanding of basic networking protocols are essential. You'll need proficiency with IP camera systems and the ability to configure and program devices effectively.

Attention to detail is critical in this position, as is a strong commitment to customer service. You'll need excellent communication skills to interact with clients and team members effectively. Problem-solving abilities and a readiness to adapt to new technologies will also serve you well in this dynamic role.
