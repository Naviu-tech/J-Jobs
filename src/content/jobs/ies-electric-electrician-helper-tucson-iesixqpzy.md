## About The Role

The Electrician Helper position at IES Electric in Tucson, AZ, offers an exciting entry into the electrical trade industry. This role is pivotal in assisting experienced electricians in the installation, repair, and maintenance of electrical systems. As an Electrician Helper, you will be immersed in a dynamic work environment, engaging in hands-on tasks that require a blend of technical knowledge, physical dexterity, and an unwavering commitment to safety. With projects ranging from residential installations to large-scale commercial developments, this position provides a broad exposure to various aspects of electrical work, making it ideal for those eager to learn and advance in their careers. Key responsibilities include preparing work areas, assisting in the installation of conduits and wiring, and ensuring all work adheres to safety and efficiency standards. This role is designed to be a stepping stone for those aiming to progress in the electrical trade, offering numerous opportunities for skill development and career advancement.

## Technical Skills & Certifications

To thrive as an Electrician Helper, a foundational understanding of electrical concepts is essential. Applicants should possess at least a high school diploma or equivalent, with a preference for those who have taken introductory courses in electricity or related fields. A basic knowledge of electrical codes, such as the National Electrical Code (NEC), is highly beneficial, as it underpins all safe electrical practices. 

Proficiency with hand tools is a must, including screwdrivers, pliers, wire strippers, and multimeters. Familiarity with power tools such as drills and saws is also advantageous. The ability to follow detailed instructions and blueprints is crucial, demanding both analytical skills and attention to detail. Candidates should demonstrate a strong work ethic, effective communication, and teamwork abilities, as these will be essential in coordinating tasks with electricians and other team members.

Physical requirements include the ability to lift and carry tools and materials, often weighing up to 50 pounds, and the capacity to work in a variety of environments, including confined spaces, heights, and outdoor settings.

Certifications such as OSHA 10-Hour Construction Safety and Health Training are preferred to ensure a baseline understanding of safety protocols. While not mandatory, a valid driver's license and reliable transportation are crucial due to the nature of job site travel.

## Project Responsibilities

As an Electrician Helper, your primary responsibility is to support electricians in the execution of electrical installations and repairs. This involves handling materials and tools, preparing work areas, and ensuring that all tasks are performed efficiently and safely. You will assist in the installation of conduits, pulling cables, and ensuring that wiring is correctly set up according to blueprints and electrical codes.

A critical part of the role includes troubleshooting minor electrical issues under the supervision of licensed electricians. This involves using diagnostic tools to identify faults and assist in implementing solutions. Safety is paramount, and adherence to strict protocols, such as lockout/tagout procedures and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, is non-negotiable. You will participate in regular safety briefings and team meetings to stay updated on best practices and project updates.

You will also be responsible for maintaining the organization of tools and equipment, documenting work activities, and supporting testing and system commissioning processes. Your willingness to learn and adapt will be key to successfully supporting complex installations and systems.

## Career Development

This role is ideal for individuals with 0-2 years of hands-on electrical experience who are eager to advance in the trade. At IES Electric, we support the progression from apprentice to journeyman electrician, offering structured training and mentorship from master electricians. 

Opportunities for further certifications and specialized training, such as becoming a Certified Electrical Safety Compliance Professional (CESCP), are available to enhance your skills and career prospects. You will be paired with experienced professionals who will guide your learning and development, providing invaluable insights into the industry.

## Compensation & Benefits

The Electrician Helper position offers a competitive salary range of $18.63 to $23.29 per hour, based on experience and skill level. IES Electric provides comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage to ensure your well-being. Employees are entitled to paid time off and holidays to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Career advancement is a key focus, with ongoing training and certification opportunities to support your growth in the trade.

Additionally, compensation for overtime and on-call duties is offered, along with continuing education benefits to encourage lifelong learning and professional development.
