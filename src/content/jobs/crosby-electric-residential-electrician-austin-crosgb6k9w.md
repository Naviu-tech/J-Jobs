Crosby Electric in Austin, TX, is looking for a talented Luxury Home Technology Specialist to join our team. If you're passionate about cutting-edge home automation and energy management, this role could be your perfect match. You'll be working in some of the most beautiful homes in Austin, and you'll also get to explore nearby spots like Round Rock, Cedar Park, and Georgetown as part of your work. We're all about creating smart, energy-efficient homes, and we need someone who shares that vision. Ready to make a difference in the world of luxury home technology? Let's dive into what your new role could look like.

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be our go-to person for installing and programming the latest and greatest in home automation systems. Think of it as making homes smarter and more efficient. You'll be integrating lighting control with voice activation and mobile apps, setting up whole-house audio/video systems, and implementing automated shade control. Security and access control integration will also be in your wheelhouse, along with energy monitoring and backup power systems. And yes, you'll be configuring home network infrastructure, which is super important. You'll document system configurations and user settings, provide client training on system operations, and keep detailed service records for these luxury properties. Plus, since Austin is growing fast, you'll be working with local building codes and standards, and occasionally you'll need to coordinate with city inspectors for larger installations. With the unique climate here, implementing energy-efficient solutions specific to Austin's heat is a must too.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with a strong knack for technology and home automation experience. Certifications in major control systems like Lutron or Control4 are a must. You'll need to understand residential networking and Wi-Fi systems and have experience working with high-end finishes and materials. Your customer service skills should be top-notch, and you'll need a professional appearance and communication ability—after all, you'll be representing Crosby Electric in some amazing homes. Experience with energy management systems is a must, and we'll need a clean background check and drug screening. You'll also need a valid driver’s license with a clean record. Since this is Austin, familiarity with the local culture and an appreciation for Texas heat will help you succeed. And if you have 1-2 years of experience in an apprentice role in a residential setting, that's a big plus.

## Compensation & Benefits
We believe in taking care of our team, so we offer a competitive salary range of $19.85-$26.32 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll have access to comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays to relax and recharge. We're committed to helping you grow, with plenty of career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications. If you're ready to bring your skills to a place where you can really make an impact, we can't wait to meet you!

We hope this gives you a good picture of what life at Crosby Electric could be like. If you're excited about the opportunity to shape the future of luxury home technology in Austin, let's connect!
