## What You'll Do as a RCP Motor Mechanic

Welcome to Burdett Hill, where we're embarking on an extensive multi-year project in Ivor, VA, with additional opportunities in nearby cities like Wakefield, Windsor, and Waverly. As a RCP Motor Mechanic, you'll play a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of our vertical motors, which are vital to our construction endeavors. Your expertise will be pivotal in keeping our projects on track and ensuring the safety and efficiency of our operations. Expect to dive deep into the intricate world of motor mechanics, where precision and attention to detail are paramount.

## Your Daily Tasks as a RCP Motor Mechanic

In your day-to-day work life at Burdett Hill, you'll be tasked with disassembling and reassembling vertical motors that can reach up to 12,000 HP and operate at 13.2 kV. This demanding work requires a keen eye and steady hands as you perform incoming and outgoing inspections and conduct test runs to ensure optimal performance.

You'll troubleshoot common issues such as oil leaks and vibrations, applying your technical knowledge to diagnose and solve problems efficiently. Working with and around radioactive materials is part of the job, so you'll need to adhere strictly to safety protocols to protect yourself and your team.

Operating forklifts, cranes, and rigging equipment will be a routine part of your day, enabling you to maneuver motor components with precision and safety. Your role also involves maintaining accurate documentation and complying with written work instructions, ensuring that all processes are transparent and traceable. Additionally, you might find yourself collaborating with other team members to strategize and implement solutions for complex mechanical challenges.

Your familiarity with rigging practices and mastery of M&TE tools such as micrometers, calipers, and torque wrenches will be crucial. A basic understanding of electrical systems will also serve you well in this position.

Completing Radiological Worker Training is mandatory, as you'll be in environments where radioactive materials are present. Strong attention to detail and a commitment to safety standards are non-negotiable traits we're looking for, ensuring you and your team maintain the highest safety levels. Your hands-on abilities, coupled with a problem-solving mentality, will set you apart as an invaluable team member.
