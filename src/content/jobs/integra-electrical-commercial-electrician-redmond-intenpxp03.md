Hey there! We're Integra Electrical, nestled in the lovely Redmond, OR. We’re on the lookout for a skilled Commercial Security Systems Specialist to join our team. If you have a knack for top-notch, enterprise-level integrated security solutions, we should chat. We cover surrounding areas like Bend, Prineville, and Sisters, so there’s plenty of interesting work to keep you busy. 

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be our go-to person for installing and maintaining commercial security systems. You'll program access control and surveillance equipment, and configure IP camera networks and VLANs. Implementing cybersecurity measures for security networks and managing credential databases will be key parts of your role. You'll coordinate with IT teams for seamless network integration and supervise the installation of biometric devices. Keeping an eye on system health, documenting system configurations, and training end-users on security platforms are all in a day’s work. Plus, you’ll integrate with building automation systems, maintain detailed testing records, and might even catch a few sunrises during after-hours support. In the Redmond area, you'll get the chance to lead on a big project at the upcoming Cascade Center development. There are also some Oregon-specific requirements, like ensuring compliance with state electrical codes.

## Required Qualifications
We’d love it if you have a Security+ certification and a solid track record with VMS platforms. Being a pro with access control systems and having IP networking chops will make you stand out. Advanced knowledge of cybersecurity protocols and certification in security system programming are big pluses. Strong IT and database management skills are essential, and you'll need experience with enterprise security architecture. A clean background check is non-negotiable. We're looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a commercial setting, ideally at a Journeyman level. And since you’ll be working in Redmond, you'd need to be familiar with local regulations and conditions.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive hourly rate, ranging from $36.37 to $41.49, depending on your experience. You’ll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, as well as paid time off and holidays. We’re big on career advancement, so there are plenty of opportunities to grow, along with ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

If this sounds like your kind of challenge, we’d love to hear from you!
