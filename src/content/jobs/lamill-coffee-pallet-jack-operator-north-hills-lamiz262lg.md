Your main responsibility will be to ensure the efficient movement of products within our warehouse, contributing to our mission of delivering high-quality coffee to our customers. This position is all about precision and efficiency, requiring you to handle both manual and electric pallet jacks with skill and care. Expect a dynamic work environment where your ability to safely and accurately transport materials is valued and relied upon.

### Your Daily Tasks as a Pallet Jack Operator

Your day will primarily involve operating both manual and electric pallet jacks to transport pallets, products, and materials across our expansive warehouse. Whether you're moving coffee beans, packaging materials, or finished products, your role is to keep things moving smoothly and efficiently.

#### Staging and Inventory Management

Part of your duties will include staging materials for shipment, working closely with warehouse workflows and schedules to ensure timely dispatches. You'll collaborate with the inventory team to track and replenish stock in picking and packing areas, maintaining seamless operations.

#### Equipment and Workspace Maintenance

Conducting routine inspections of pallet jacks to ensure they are in perfect working condition and reporting any malfunctions is vital. Additionally, keeping the loading docks, storage areas, and workspaces organized and clean is part of maintaining our high standards.

- Ability to lift and move items weighing up to 50 pounds and withstand long periods of standing.
- Strong attention to detail for accurate material handling and inventory tracking.
- Basic communication skills for effective teamwork and coordination.
- Understanding of warehouse safety standards and best practices.

#### Preferred Experience
