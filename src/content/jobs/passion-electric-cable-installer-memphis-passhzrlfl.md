Join us at Passion Electric in Memphis, TN, where we're all about connecting people and technology. We're on the lookout for a Data Center Cable Installation Technician to be part of our team. If you’re in Memphis or nearby cities like Bartlett, Germantown, or Southaven, we’d love to hear from you. This role is all about diving into the nuts and bolts of data center infrastructure, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently. You’ll be working with structured cabling and fiber optics, and we promise, it’s as challenging as it is rewarding!

## Key Responsibilities
As part of our team, you'll design and install structured cabling systems for data centers and enterprise networks. You’ll handle high-density fiber optic cable installations and certify these systems using advanced testing equipment. It’s all about keeping things tidy, so we count on you to implement proper cable management in network rooms. Your tasks also include terminating and testing high-speed copper and fiber connections, maintaining detailed testing documentation and warranties, and coordinating pathway installation with other trades. You’ll get involved with data center hot aisle/cold aisle separation and install overhead cable tray and ladder rack systems. Plus, you’ll maintain clean room protocols for sensitive environments. In the Memphis area, you'll also engage with regional contractors, support local infrastructure upgrades, and ensure compliance with Tennessee-specific regulations.

## Required Qualifications
We’re looking for someone with a BICSI Installer 1 certification—Installer 2 is a bonus! You should have solid experience with fiber optic installation and testing and be proficient with multiple certification testers. Understanding data center design principles is crucial. You’ll need to be experienced with cable management systems and pathways, know clean room procedures, and have the ability to read and create cable installation drawings. Understanding network hardware requirements is key. Specifically for Memphis, you’ll need 1-5 years of experience with Voice Data work in a commercial setting. Experience working with Tennessee’s state-of-the-art data center protocols and familiarity with local safety standards are also important.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary ranging from $21.27 to $29.5 per hour, depending on your experience. You’ll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We’re big on career advancement, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop your skills through ongoing training and certifications.
