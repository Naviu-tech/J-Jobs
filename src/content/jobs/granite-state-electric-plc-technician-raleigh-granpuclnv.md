## What You'll Do as a PLC Technician

As a PLC Technician at Granite State Electric, you'll be at the heart of our automation projects in Raleigh and its surrounding areas, including Cary, Durham, and Chapel Hill. Your role is pivotal in ensuring the smooth operation of our PLC systems, supporting the infrastructure of various construction projects. Your expertise will be instrumental in integrating and troubleshooting control systems, directly contributing to the success of our multi-year projects in the region.

## Your Daily Tasks as a PLC Technician

Your day-to-day will involve leading the commissioning and startup of PLC and DDC control systems. You'll ensure these systems integrate seamlessly and perform reliably in environments that demand precision and efficiency. Collaboration is key; you'll work closely with engineers, clients, and electrical teams to tackle automation challenges and deliver high-quality outcomes.

Maintaining detailed records of system modifications and operations will also be part of your routine, ensuring all project documentation reflects current statuses accurately. Youâ€™ll provide technical leadership on-site, guiding subcontractors, enforcing quality control standards, and swiftly resolving any issues that arise. Expect to travel to client sites as needed, up to 30% of the time, to oversee project implementation and ensure operational success.

Additionally, you will frequently:

- Conduct routine inspections and diagnostics of PLC systems to preemptively identify potential issues.
- Perform software updates and hardware installations to keep systems running optimally.
- Collaborate with the project management team to provide status updates and suggest improvements for system efficiency.

## What You Need to Be a PLC Technician

To excel in this role, you need at least 2 years of experience working with platforms like Siemens TIA Portal, Allen Bradley Studio 5000, or similar systems such as Inductive Automation Ignition or ICONICS. Your hands-on experience in PLC installation, commissioning, and troubleshooting will be crucial.

A strong understanding of HVAC control theory, electronics, and electrical circuits is essential. You'll need excellent communication skills to work effectively across teams, the ability to work independently, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. Your technical expertise should be complemented by a practical mindset and a keen eye for detail.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $58.28-$72.84 per hour, depending on your experience. At Granite State Electric, we are committed to your professional growth, providing career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp.
