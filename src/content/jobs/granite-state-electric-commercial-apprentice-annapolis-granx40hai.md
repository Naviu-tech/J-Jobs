Hey there! We're Granite State Electric, and we're on the lookout for a motivated Commercial Apprentice to join our team in beautiful Annapolis, MD. If you're in the area or from nearby cities like Bowie, Severna Park, or Glen Burnie, we’d love to hear from you! Nestled right by the Chesapeake Bay, Annapolis offers a vibrant community and plenty of exciting projects to dive into. As a Commercial Construction Apprentice Electrician, you’ll get hands-on experience with new construction and tenant improvement projects in various settings like office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial facilities. We’re all about learning and growth, so if you’re ready to kickstart your career in commercial electrical work, you’ve come to the right place!

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you'll be right in the thick of things, assisting with the installation of commercial electrical systems. You’ll get to learn the ins and outs of power distribution, lighting controls, and fire alarm systems. Our seasoned journeyman electricians will show you the ropes of conduit bending and installation techniques for EMT and rigid conduit. You’ll help with wire pulling and termination in electrical rooms, support panel installation, and get hands-on experience with circuit identification. Lighting fixture installation and controls programming will become second nature to you, and you'll learn the basics of building automation systems. Plus, you’ll assist with emergency lighting installation and testing, keep our material inventory organized, and document daily work progress.

And because we're in the Annapolis area, you'll have the chance to engage with projects that might require knowledge of local electrical codes and regulations specific to Maryland. You might find yourself working on historical buildings where special care is needed, or on waterfront properties that demand extra attention due to environmental considerations.

## Required Qualifications

To join us, you need a high school diploma or GED and strong math skills to tackle those tricky calculations. You should be enrolled in a state-approved electrical apprenticeship program, with a basic understanding of electrical theory. If you can read basic blueprints and construction drawings, you’re already ahead of the game! Proficiency with hand and power tools is a must, and you’ll need a valid driver's license with a clean record to get around our various job sites.

You should be comfortable lifting 50+ pounds regularly and have good communication skills to ensure smooth job site coordination. Basic computer skills are also needed for documentation purposes. For our Annapolis projects, familiarity with Maryland state building codes would be a bonus. And if you’ve got a knack for working in coastal environments or on historic properties, even better!

## Compensation & Benefits

We believe in rewarding hard work, so we offer a competitive salary ranging from $21.50 to $27.07 per hour, depending on your experience. Our comprehensive benefits package includes medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. At Granite State Electric, we’re committed to your growth, offering career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to help you climb the ladder to a journeyman role.

We can’t wait to welcome you to our team and support your journey in the exciting world of commercial electrical work. If you’re ready to take the plunge, apply today and let’s get started on building something great together!
