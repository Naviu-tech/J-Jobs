## The Apprentice Electrician Position

Joining our team as an Apprentice Electrician means you will be involved in day-to-day tasks that are both challenging and rewarding.

The environments you'll work in are diverse, requiring adaptability and a keen eye for detail. You'll be supported by a team structure that includes Senior Electricians and Project Managers, providing supervision and mentorship. At Granite State Electric, there is significant growth potential; many of our Apprentice Electricians advance to higher roles within the company, thanks to our focus on training and development.

## Core Apprentice Electrician Responsibilities

As an Apprentice Electrician with Granite State Electric, your responsibilities will include supporting the installation of solar arrays, battery systems, and EV chargers on commercial properties. You will assist in running and securing conduit for DC wiring from solar modules to inverters and perform basic wiring tasks, such as terminating PV modules and connecting battery storage systems. Advanced duties include learning to test and troubleshoot solar inverters and monitoring systems under supervision, as well as coordinating material preparation, pre-assembling racking systems, and ensuring tools are organized. Safety is a top priority, and you will follow strict safety procedures for rooftop work, including the use of fall protection equipment. Regional projects may also involve working in nearby cities like Huntersville and Matthews, where you'll apply your skills to a variety of site-specific challenges.

## Required Experience & Skills

Ideal candidates will have a strong understanding of basic electrical principles, including DC power systems, and a willingness to work outdoors on rooftops in varying weather conditions. You should be able to follow technical instructions for assembling and wiring renewable energy systems and possess strong organizational skills for material handling and job site preparation. Experience with hand tools and basic testing equipment is essential. We require 1-4 years minimum experience as an Apprentice Electrician. Essential certifications include OSHA 10, CPR/First Aid, and any relevant state electrical training certificates. Technical knowledge of renewable energy systems, particularly solar and battery storage, is highly valued.

## Tools & Equipment

Our Apprentice Electricians use a variety of tools daily, including wire strippers, multimeters, and conduit benders. You are expected to have personal tools such as a tool belt, screwdrivers, and pliers. Granite State Electric provides company-specific equipment, including specialized testing tools and safety gear, ensuring you have everything you need to perform your job effectively and safely.

## Physical Requirements

This role requires the ability to lift up to 50 pounds regularly and work in various conditions, including rooftops and construction sites. You will need to be comfortable working at heights and in confined spaces. Safety gear, including hard hats, safety glasses, gloves, and fall protection harnesses, is mandatory and provided by the company to ensure your safety on the job.
