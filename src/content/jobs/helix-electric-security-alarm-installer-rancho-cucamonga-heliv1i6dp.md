Are you ready to join the Helix Electric team as a Security Alarm Installer? We're working on an exciting multi-year project in Rancho Cucamonga, CA, with additional projects in nearby cities such as Ontario, Upland, Fontana, and Chino. As a Security Alarm Installer, you'll play a crucial role in the safety and security of residential and small business properties, ensuring peace of mind for our clients. Your day-to-day tasks will involve hands-on installations, testing, and maintenance of security systems. This is a practical, hands-on position where you will make a real difference in the community.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Security Alarm Installer

### Installation and Configuration

Your primary responsibility will be installing and configuring state-of-the-art security alarm systems. This includes setting up sensors, control panels, and communication modules. You'll work closely with other team members to ensure systems are installed efficiently and according to specification.

### System Testing and Troubleshooting

Once installation is complete, you'll test the system to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Troubleshooting is a big part of the job, and you'll need to address any issues that arise during the installation process. This will involve using diagnostic tools to identify problems and implement solutions quickly.

### Programming and Customization

You'll program the alarm systems to meet customer specifications, which might include setting up remote access features and integrating monitoring services. It's important that each system is tailored to the unique needs of the client, providing them with the highest level of security.

### Customer Education and Support

A significant part of your role is educating customers on how to operate and manage their security systems effectively. You'll ensure they are comfortable with the technology and know how to respond to alerts or issues. Providing exceptional customer service is key to ensuring client satisfaction.

### Maintenance and Documentation

Routine maintenance tasks, such as battery replacements and firmware updates, will be part of your daily activities. You'll also maintain detailed records of all installations, tests, and service calls, ensuring comprehensive documentation for future reference.

## What You Need to Be a Security Alarm Installer

### Experience and Skills

We're looking for candidates with 1-3 years of experience in the field as a Security Alarm Installer. You should have experience with low-voltage wiring and basic electronics, and be familiar with common hand tools and diagnostic equipment. Strong problem-solving skills are essential for addressing installation and service challenges.

### Customer Service and Independence

You'll often work independently, so self-motivation and the ability to work without supervision are important. Excellent customer service skills are essential to ensure client satisfaction and system understanding. 

### Physical and Licensure Requirements

You must be comfortable working in both indoor and outdoor environments and have a valid driverâ€™s license, as travel between job sites in Rancho Cucamonga and neighboring areas is required.
