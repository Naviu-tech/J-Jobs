## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician with Collins Electrical, you'll be an essential part of our team, working on an exciting multi-year project in Paramount, CA, with additional projects in nearby cities like Bellflower, Downey, Long Beach, and Lakewood. Your role will be pivotal in installing and maintaining electrical systems, with a special focus on electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This position offers the opportunity to work on innovative infrastructure projects that are shaping the future of transportation and energy.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Install and Maintain Electrical Systems

Your day-to-day tasks will include the installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of electrical systems, particularly for EV charging stations. You'll work with service panels, transformers, and related components, ensuring everything is up to code and functioning efficiently.

### Conduit Work and Wiring

You'll be responsible for accurately measuring, cutting, and bending conduit (EMT, rigid) for installations. Precision is key, as you'll need to ensure precise alignment. Once the conduit is in place, you'll pull, label, and terminate wiring, maintaining clean and organized connections in compliance with NEC and California Electric Code standards.

### Load Calculations and System Testing

Part of your role involves performing load calculations and installing main service equipment for EV charging infrastructure. You'll conduct system testing to verify performance, safety, and compliance with site specifications, ensuring everything operates smoothly.

### Collaboration and Supervision

You'll work collaboratively with project managers and other trades to meet construction schedules, delivering quality installations on time. You'll also supervise apprentices, ensuring they adhere to safety protocols and best practices while mentoring them on EV-specific electrical systems.

### Documentation and Reporting

Maintaining accurate documentation of installations and site activities is crucial. You'll be required to submit daily reports, detailing the progress and any issues encountered, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project.

### Additional Activities

- Regularly inspect electrical components and recommend necessary repairs or enhancements.
- Troubleshoot and resolve any electrical issues swiftly to minimize downtime.
- Participate in team meetings to discuss project progress and address any concerns.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To excel in this role, you must have an active and valid journeyman electrician certification from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). A strong knowledge of the NEC and California Electric Code is essential, particularly with experience in EV charging station installations.

### Must-Have Skills

- 3-5 years of experience as a Journeyman Electrician.
- Proficiency with conduit bending tools, multimeters, and other diagnostic equipment.
- Ability to read and interpret blueprints, schematics, and electrical diagrams.
- Demonstrated leadership skills in supervising apprentices and managing on-site safety.
- Excellent communication and organizational skills to ensure project success.

We offer a competitive salary range of $40.11-$48.43 per hour, depending on experience.
