Hey there! Are you ready to be part of something big in Dover, DE? At Granite State Electric, we're on the lookout for a passionate and skilled Security Technician to join our team. You'll be working in a vibrant area, close to great places like Camden, Smyrna, and Milford. If you've got a knack for enterprise security systems and love the idea of protecting what's important, we'd love to hear from you!

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be designing and setting up top-notch security systems, from configuring IP camera networks with VLANs and QoS settings to programming access control databases. We need you to install and manage biometric security devices, integrate these systems with building automation, and keep everything running smoothly with regular health checks and maintenance. Plus, you'll be the go-to person for cybersecurity best practices and provide training to keep everyone in the loop. In Dover, you'll also be tackling region-specific security needs and ensuring compliance with Delaware’s local regulations. 

## Required Qualifications
Here's what we're looking for: you should have your ESA Level 1 certification under your belt, and a CompTIA Security+ cert would be a big plus. We’d love for you to have experience with enterprise video management systems and a strong grasp of IP networking and cybersecurity. You should be comfortable managing access control databases and have a knack for working with biometric security systems. A clean background check is a must, and you should be ready for government clearance if needed. Ideally, you've got 1-3 years of experience in commercial security work, and familiarity with Dover's local security standards is a big advantage.

## Compensation & Benefits
Join us, and you'll enjoy a competitive salary of $26.47-$34.11 per hour based on your experience. We offer comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities for career growth and ongoing training to keep your skills sharp. 

We're excited to find someone who’s ready to dive into the world of security with us in Dover. If you think you're up for the challenge, let's chat!
