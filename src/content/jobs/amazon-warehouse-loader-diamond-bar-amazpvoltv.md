## What You'll Do as a Warehouse Loader

As a Warehouse Loader at our Diamond Bar location, your role is integral to the seamless operation of our logistics team. You'll be responsible for ensuring that all our outgoing shipments are loaded accurately and securely. This position keeps you on your toes in a fast-paced environment, where your attention to detail and commitment to safety are paramount. Your daily efforts contribute significantly to the success of our supply chain operations.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Warehouse Loader

As part of your daily responsibilities, you'll be expected to efficiently load outgoing trucks. This involves not only placing goods on trucks but doing so in a manner that ensures the safety of the products during transport. You'll need to verify shipment details against manifests to confirm that everything is accurate before dispatch.

Moreover, maintaining an organized loading dock and staging area is crucial. This organization helps streamline operations and ensures that the right products are loaded onto the correct vehicles. You'll frequently operate forklifts or electric pallet jacks to maneuver heavy goods, so comfort with these tools is essential.

Collaboration is key in this role. You'll work closely with our warehouse and logistics teams to meet strict shipping deadlines. This may include assisting with inventory management or helping to resolve any discrepancies that arise during the loading process. Additionally, you'll conduct routine equipment checks and report any maintenance needs to ensure ongoing operations without interruptions.

## What You Need to Be a Warehouse Loader

To excel as a Warehouse Loader, you'll need a high school diploma or equivalent. Previous experience in a shipping or receiving environment is highly preferred, as it gives you a jumpstart in understanding the intricacies of the role. Ideally, you should have at least one year of experience in a similar position.

Physical stamina is a must; you'll be required to lift and carry heavy loads regularly. While not mandatory, a forklift certification is a significant advantage and demonstrates your capability to handle essential warehouse equipment safely and efficiently.

Key skills include attention to detail, organizational abilities, and effective communication. You'll also need to exhibit strong teamwork skills as you'll be a pivotal part of a larger logistics operation.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $21.07 to $25.22 per hour, depending on your experience and qualifications. Our compensation package includes opportunities for career advancement, allowing you to grow within the company. We also provide ongoing training and certifications, ensuring that you continue to develop your skills and stay updated with industry standards.

As a Warehouse Loader, you'll enjoy a range of benefits, including health insurance, paid time off, and retirement savings plans. Our commitment to employee development means you'll have access to comprehensive training programs, equipping you with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in your role and advance your career.
