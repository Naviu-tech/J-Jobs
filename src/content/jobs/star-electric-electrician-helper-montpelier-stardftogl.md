## What You'll Do as an Electrician Helper

Welcome to Star Electric, where we're embarking on an exciting multi-year project in Montpelier, VT, with additional opportunities in nearby cities such as Barre, Waterbury, and Northfield. As an Electrician Helper, you'll be an essential part of our team, providing support to our skilled electricians on various residential and light commercial construction projects. Your role is crucial in ensuring that electrical installations are completed efficiently and safely, contributing to the overall success of our projects.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician Helper

Working as an Electrician Helper, you'll find yourself in the thick of action every day. Your primary responsibility is to assist our electricians by carrying materials, tools, and equipment to different work areas. You'll ensure that job sites remain tidy and organized, which is key to maintaining a safe working environment. 

You'll also help with pulling wires and cables through conduits and walls, a task that requires precision and care. Under guidance, you'll support the installation of lighting fixtures, outlets, and switchgear. Some of your daily activities might include drilling holes, mounting electrical boxes, and labeling wires accurately. You will prepare tools and materials needed for each task and start learning to identify various electrical components. Reading basic diagrams to assist in system assembly will also be a part of your learning curve.

Additionally, you'll often perform routine checks and maintenance tasks, such as testing electrical systems or replacing faulty components, which will help hone your troubleshooting skills.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician Helper

To excel as an Electrician Helper, you need a keen willingness to learn the electrical trade and adhere strictly to safety protocols. A basic understanding of tools used in electrical work, such as drills, saws, and voltage testers, is essential. The job is physically demanding, so you'll need the ability to lift and carry heavy materials, work on ladders, and perform repetitive tasks with ease.

Attention to detail and the ability to follow instructions precisely are crucial in this role. A strong work ethic and reliability are also vital, as you'll be working in a fast-paced construction environment. Experience ranging from 0-2 years in the field can be beneficial, but a hands-on approach and eagerness to gain practical skills are what truly matter.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $18.05 to $21.74 per hour, depending on your experience. At Star Electric, we believe in investing in our team, so there are ample career advancement opportunities along with ongoing training and certifications to help you grow within the company.
