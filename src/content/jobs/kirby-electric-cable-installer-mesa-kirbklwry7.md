## About Our Cable Installer Team
At Kirby Electric, we pride ourselves on setting the standard for excellence in cable installation across Mesa, AZ, and the surrounding areas, including Gilbert, Chandler, Tempe, and Scottsdale. Our Cable Installer team is known for its dedication to precision, quality, and safety in every project we undertake. As a cornerstone of the Mesa community for over two decades, Kirby Electric has established a reputation for reliability and expertise, handling a diverse range of projects from commercial complexes to industrial facilities. Our team embodies a spirit of collaboration and innovation, consistently exceeding client expectations and contributing to the growth and development of the greater Mesa region.

## The Cable Installer Position
Joining Kirby Electric as a Cable Installer means becoming a vital part of a dynamic team that thrives on challenging and rewarding projects. Day-to-day, you'll engage in a variety of tasks, from laying out and installing structured cabling systems to troubleshooting complex connectivity issues. Our projects span commercial and industrial environments, providing a stimulating workplace where no two days are the same. You'll work under the guidance of seasoned supervisors and collaborate with a team of skilled professionals, ensuring that each project is executed with precision and efficiency. Kirby Electric is committed to fostering growth, offering clear pathways for advancement and skill enhancement within the company.

## Core Cable Installer Responsibilities
As a Cable Installer with Kirby Electric, you will be responsible for the installation of structured cabling systems, including Cat5e, Cat6, and cutting-edge fiber optics, across diverse commercial and industrial settings. Your expertise will be crucial in terminating and testing both copper and fiber optic cables using precision tools and advanced testers. You'll mount, secure, and organize network racks, patch panels, and cable trays, ensuring that cables are dressed and bundled to meet both site-specific and industry standards. Troubleshooting connectivity issues during and after installations will be part of your daily routine, as will reading and interpreting blueprints and construction diagrams to guarantee accuracy.

In addition to these core tasks, you will engage in advanced technical duties such as implementing network security measures, integrating cabling systems with complex IT infrastructures, and optimizing network performance through strategic cable routing. You'll coordinate with project teams on large-scale infrastructure projects in the Mesa area, and you'll maintain meticulous installation records, always adhering to our stringent quality and safety protocols, including OSHA compliance and Kirby Electric's proprietary safety standards.

## Required Experience & Skills
To excel in this role, you should bring extensive experience with structured cabling, particularly in terminating and testing fiber optics. A deep understanding of TIA/EIA cabling standards is essential, along with strong troubleshooting skills and an ability to manage tools and inventory efficiently. We require a minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a Cable Installer. Essential certifications include BICSI Installer 1 or 2, FOA Certified Fiber Optic Technician (CFOT), and OSHA 10-hour or 30-hour Construction Safety Certification. Your technical knowledge should encompass both copper and fiber optic cabling, network infrastructure, and electrical systems.

## Tools & Equipment
Our Cable Installers utilize a range of specific tools daily, including cable testers, punch-down tools, fusion splicers, and optical time domain reflectometers (OTDRs). Personal tools such as wire strippers, crimpers, and screwdrivers are required. While we expect our installers to arrive equipped with their personal tools, Kirby Electric provides company-issued equipment, including advanced testing devices and safety gear, ensuring you have everything needed to perform at your best.

## Physical Requirements
The role of a Cable Installer at Kirby Electric requires the ability to lift and maneuver heavy equipment and materials, frequently lifting up to 50 pounds. You'll work in various conditions, from confined spaces to elevated platforms, requiring agility and endurance. Safety gear, including hard hats, gloves, and safety glasses, is mandatory on all job sites to maintain compliance with safety regulations and to protect our valued team members.

## Training & Development
Kirby Electric is committed to your professional growth through our comprehensive Cable Installer mentorship program, which pairs you with seasoned experts to enhance your skills and knowledge. We offer a range of certifications, such as BICSI and FOA, to bolster your professional credentials. Our clear career advancement path is designed to promote from within, providing opportunities to progress to supervisory and managerial roles.

## Compensation Package
We offer a competitive salary range of $20.53-$26.97 per hour, reflecting your experience and expertise. Our compensation package includes career advancement opportunities, ongoing training, and certification support. Our overtime policies are generous, ensuring fair compensation for extra hours worked. Tool allowances are provided, alongside additional perks such as health benefits, retirement savings plans, and paid time off, making Kirby Electric a rewarding place to build your career.
