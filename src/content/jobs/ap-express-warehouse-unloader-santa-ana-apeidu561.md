## What You'll Do as a Warehouse Unloader

As a Warehouse Unloader at AP Express, your main responsibility will be to ensure the smooth and efficient handling of all incoming shipments at our Santa Ana location. Our facility is a bustling hub of activity, and we rely on our unloaders to keep the supply chain moving. You'll be an integral part of our team, working on the front lines to make sure goods are received, inspected, and stored properly. This role is all about being hands-on and detail-oriented, ensuring that each item is accounted for and in the right place.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Warehouse Unloader

### Unloading and Inspection

Your day will begin with unloading incoming shipments from delivery trucks. This involves physically moving items from the truck to the receiving area, checking each package for damage or missing items. You'll need to be thorough in your inspections to ensure that all goods meet our quality standards before they enter the warehouse.

### Inventory Management

Once items are unloaded, you'll use RF scanners to track inventory. This technology helps us maintain accurate records and streamline our processes. You'll log each item into our warehouse management system, ensuring that everything is accounted for and can be easily located when needed.

### Organization and Maintenance

Part of your role will also involve organizing incoming shipments on the receiving dock. This means categorizing and storing items in their designated locations within the warehouse. Keeping your workspace clean and safe is crucial, as it prevents accidents and ensures a smooth workflow. You'll also help with periodic stock checks and inventory audits to maintain accuracy.

### Additional Activities

In addition to these core tasks, you might occasionally assist with loading outgoing shipments or help with general warehouse maintenance tasks. Flexibility and teamwork are key, as you'll work closely with other team members to meet daily goals and deadlines.

## What You Need to Be a Warehouse Unloader

### Qualifications

To excel in this role, you should have at least a high school diploma or equivalent. Prior experience in a similar position is beneficial, with 1+ years as a Warehouse Unloader being preferred.

### Physical and Technical Skills

You'll need to be physically fit, as the job requires lifting up to 50 pounds and standing for extended periods. Familiarity with warehouse management systems and RF scanners is a plus, though we provide training for those eager to learn.

### Essential Abilities

Key skills include attention to detail, the ability to work independently, and strong organizational skills. Being proactive and having a keen eye for identifying discrepancies are also crucial for success in this role.

## Compensation

### Competitive Salary and Benefits

We offer a competitive hourly wage, ranging from $20.84 to $25.03, depending on your experience. In addition to financial compensation, you'll have access to career advancement opportunities within AP Express. 

### Training and Development

We believe in investing in our employees, which is why we provide ongoing training and certifications to help you grow in your career. You'll have the chance to learn new skills and advance within the company, making this not just a job, but a stepping stone to a brighter future.
