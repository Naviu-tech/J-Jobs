## What You'll Do as a Warehouse Picker & Packer

As a Warehouse Picker & Packer at Boeing's San Bernardino facility, you'll play a crucial role in ensuring the seamless operation of our supply chain. This position is integral to maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of our warehouse activities. Your primary mission is to pick and pack products based on order requirements, facilitating timely and precise shipment to various locations. Your work will directly impact the quality of service we provide to our clients and partners.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Warehouse Picker & Packer

Your day will start with a briefing on the day's orders and priorities. Using handheld scanners, you'll locate and pick items from designated shelves, ensuring each product matches the order specifications. You will then pack these items securely, maintaining high standards of accuracy and quality. Keeping your packing station organized and clean is essential for efficiency and safety.

In addition to picking and packing, you'll regularly communicate with inventory teams to ensure that stock levels in picking areas are maintained. You'll also contribute to inventory cycle counts and report any discrepancies to the inventory manager. Meeting daily quotas for order processing is crucial, and you'll collaborate with your team to achieve these goals while maintaining a positive and proactive approach.

## What You Need to Be a Warehouse Picker & Packer

To thrive in this role, you should have at least a high school diploma or equivalent. Experience working in a fast-paced environment is beneficial, as is a strong attention to detail to ensure the accuracy of orders. Familiarity with handheld scanners or warehouse management systems will give you a head start, though training will be provided.

We're looking for candidates with at least 1+ years of experience in a similar role. Essential skills include effective communication, organizational abilities, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. Physical stamina is also important, as the role involves standing for extended periods and occasionally lifting heavy items.

## Compensation

Boeing offers a competitive salary range for this position, from $21.09 to $24.08 per hour, depending on your experience. We are committed to your professional growth, providing career advancement opportunities and ongoing training to enhance your skills.

You'll benefit from a comprehensive package that includes health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. We believe in investing in our team, so you'll have access to various training programs and certifications to support your career progression within the company.
