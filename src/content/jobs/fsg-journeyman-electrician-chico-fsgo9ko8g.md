## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician with FSG, you'll play a pivotal role in our ambitious multi-year projects centered in Chico, CA, and extending to neighboring cities such as Paradise, Oroville, and Red Bluff. Your work will be crucial in constructing cutting-edge medical facilities that prioritize safety and efficiency. This role demands a solid understanding of complex electrical systems, and you'll be at the forefront of ensuring these systems are implemented seamlessly within new hospital constructions. Your expertise will be instrumental in bringing these essential healthcare projects to life.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Hospital Electrical System Installations

On a typical day, you'll be installing and maintaining intricate electrical systems in various sections of the hospital, including patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units. You'll be responsible for routing, bending, and installing different types of conduit (such as EMT and rigid) to support high-density wiring necessary for medical-grade equipment.

### Compliance and Safety

Ensuring proper grounding and bonding of all systems is paramount. You'll be working in compliance with the National Electrical Code (NEC) and hospital-specific codes, collaborating closely with engineers and medical equipment specialists to ensure power systems meet design specifications and safety standards.

### System Management and Troubleshooting

You'll perform load calculations, install service equipment, and manage emergency power systems and backup generators. Part of your role will involve supervising apprentices, guiding them to adhere to safety protocols and maintain high-quality workmanship. You'll also troubleshoot and test critical electrical systems, including fire alarm circuits, nurse call systems, and life safety equipment. Additionally, you'll regularly inspect and maintain electrical panels and lighting systems to ensure optimal performance.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

### Certification and Experience

To qualify, you must hold a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations and have over 5 years of field experience as a Journeyman Electrician. Your extensive knowledge of NEC and healthcare-specific electrical standards will be crucial to your success in this role.

### Technical and Communication Skills

You should have hands-on experience with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits. The ability to read and interpret complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals is essential. Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters is required. Strong communication skills are a must, as you'll need to collaborate effectively with diverse teams in high-pressure environments.
