Welcome to Safe Electric in beautiful Fayetteville, AR—your new home for an exciting career in security technology! Nestled in the heart of the Ozarks, Fayetteville is surrounded by charming cities like Springdale, Rogers, and Bentonville. It's a vibrant community where innovation meets natural beauty. We're on the lookout for a skilled Enterprise Security Systems Technician to join our team and help us create cutting-edge integrated security solutions. If you're ready to bring your expertise in video surveillance, access control, and intrusion detection systems to a company that values your skills, we want to hear from you!

## Key Responsibilities
In this role, you'll be the mastermind behind designing and implementing top-notch security systems for our enterprise clients. You'll configure IP camera networks, ensuring those VLANs and QoS settings are spot-on. Programming access control databases and managing credentials will be second nature to you. Plus, you'll get to install and fine-tune biometric security devices, configure cloud-based platforms, and keep a watchful eye through system health checks and maintenance.

You'll also integrate security systems with building automation in the Fayetteville area and stay up-to-date with regional cybersecurity standards. There's a bit of travel involved, so familiarity with the local landscape is a plus. And since we're all about community, you might find yourself leading safety workshops or offering tips to local businesses about securing their premises. It's all part of making Fayetteville a safer place!

## Required Qualifications
To be successful in this role, you'll need your ESA Level 1 certification under your belt, and CompTIA Security+ would be the cherry on top! We’re looking for someone with proven experience in enterprise video management systems and a strong grasp of IP networking and cybersecurity. If you've got a knack for managing access control databases and have experience with biometric security systems, you're our kind of candidate.

You should have 1-3 years of experience in commercial security work, ideally in the Fayetteville area, and a clean background check (because integrity matters). Plus, if you know your way around the University of Arkansas campus or have experience working with local government buildings, that's a huge bonus!

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary ranging from $25.22 to $33.98 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays to recharge. We also believe in your growth, so there are plenty of career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game.

Join us at Safe Electric, where we’re more than a company—we’re a community. Let's work together to keep Fayetteville safe and secure!
