Are you ready to take your expertise in electrical systems to the next level? At Advantage Electric, we're on the lookout for a Senior Service Electrician to join our team in sunny Orlando, FL. Our focus is on critical facilities and power quality, and we're excited to bring someone on board who can navigate the complexities of power systems with ease. You'll be serving areas not just in Orlando, but also in nearby cities like Kissimmee, Sanford, and Winter Park. If you're passionate about diagnostics, power monitoring, and building automation, we want to hear from you!

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be diving into advanced electrical system diagnostics using power quality analyzers, thermal cameras, and oscilloscopes. Troubleshooting building automation integration issues and designing power factor correction solutions will be second nature to you. Your role will include managing emergency power system testing and maintenance, and you'll be creating maintenance programs for critical facilities. Training facility staff on electrical system operations and coordinating service upgrades with utilities are also in your wheelhouse. In Orlando, you’ll also tackle challenges unique to the region, like addressing power quality issues due to Florida's frequent thunderstorms and ensuring systems are hurricane-ready.

## Required Qualifications
You need a Journeyman License, and while a Master Electrician certification would be fantastic, it’s not mandatory. Advanced certifications in power quality analysis and extensive experience with thermal imaging are essential. We’re looking for someone with proven expertise in critical power systems and advanced troubleshooting skills across various systems. In Orlando, having experience with systems that handle high humidity and understanding local power grid issues is a plus. A minimum of 7 years of experience in a commercial setting is required to handle the challenges of this role.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary range from $37.01 to $42.47 per hour, based on your experience. Our comprehensive benefits package includes medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in career growth, offering opportunities for advancement and ongoing training and certifications. Join us and be part of a team that values expertise and dedication.
