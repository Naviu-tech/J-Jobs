Hey there! We're thrilled you're considering joining us at InScope as a Fire Alarm Installer. Based in Beaumont, TX, we're looking for someone to help us tackle exciting new commercial construction projects. You'll be working on-site in Beaumont and nearby cities like Port Arthur and Orange. So, if you're a fire alarm whiz, we want to hear from you!

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be diving into a bunch of hands-on work, including installing fire alarm control panels and devices. You'll pull and terminate fire alarm cables like a pro and mount all those notification appliances and initiation devices. Plus, you'll get to assist with system programming and testing—super important stuff! We expect you to keep detailed wiring records and coordinate with other trades to make sure everything’s in its rightful place.

In the Beaumont area, you'll also help us navigate regional requirements for Texas, ensuring we're up to code. Plus, you'll work on a big project we've got coming up at the Beaumont Civic Center. You might find yourself troubleshooting system wiring issues or lending a hand during final testing phases. It's all part of the fun!

## Required Qualifications
Got experience with commercial fire alarm systems? Perfect! You should be comfy reading blueprints and have a good grasp of NFPA 72 requirements and fire alarm circuit types. Being able to use a multimeter and testing equipment is key. And, of course, attention to detail is a must for all that documentation. 

We're looking for someone with 1-3 years of fire alarm work experience in a commercial setting. Familiarity with local Beaumont regulations and a knack for voltage drop calculations will definitely make you stand out. Good communication skills are essential for coordinating with the team and other trades on site.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary range from $24.97 to $33.56 per hour, based on your experience. You'll have access to comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, plus paid time off and holidays. There are plenty of opportunities for career advancement, and we provide ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the top of your game. 

If this sounds like the perfect fit for you, we'd love to chat!
