Your role is crucial in ensuring the seamless integration and operation of building automation systems. You'll work on multi-year projects that demand your expertise in creating efficient, safe, and modern building environments.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Building Automation Technician

### Programming and Commissioning

Your day will often start with programming and commissioning building automation systems. Youâ€™ll configure Direct Digital Control (DDC) systems for HVAC and other mechanical systems, ensuring they operate optimally. This requires attention to detail and a solid understanding of the systems you're working with.

### Troubleshooting and Maintenance

A significant part of your day will involve troubleshooting. Whether it's network configuration issues or mechanical integration challenges, you'll be the go-to person for diagnosing and resolving problems. Your ability to think on your feet and apply your technical knowledge is vital here.

### Collaboration and Communication

You'll regularly collaborate with project managers to ensure projects stay on track and within budget. Communication is key, not just with your team but also with clients who rely on your expertise to understand the systems in place. Effective communication ensures everyone is on the same page and projects progress smoothly.

### Documentation and Safety Compliance

Maintaining accurate project records is essential. You'll document installation processes meticulously, ensuring compliance with all relevant codes and regulations. Adhering to safety protocols is a non-negotiable part of your role, protecting not just yourself but everyone on site.

Proficiency in troubleshooting both electrical and networking systems is a must. Familiarity with HVAC operations and DDC systems will serve you well, as will the ability to read and interpret electrical diagrams.

### Physical and Communication Abilities

Strong verbal and written communication skills are essential, enabling you to liaise effectively with clients and colleagues. Physically, you'll need to be capable of lifting up to 50 lbs. and comfortable working on construction sites.

### Hands-On Expertise

Your hands-on abilities will be critical, from setting up complex systems to performing on-site diagnostics. Being able to apply your technical knowledge practically is what will make you successful in this role.
