With a commitment to quality and innovation, we take pride in our ability to deliver top-notch fiber optic solutions across a variety of projects. Our technicians are involved in cutting-edge installations, from commercial to industrial settings, ensuring that our clients receive the best possible service. Our projects extend beyond Franklin to neighboring cities such as Brentwood, Cool Springs, and Murfreesboro, allowing our team to work on diverse and challenging tasks that require precision and expertise.

## The Fiber Optics Technician Position

Joining our team as a Fiber Optics Technician means being at the forefront of technological advancements in the field. Day-to-day, you will engage in activities ranging from the installation and maintenance of fiber optic cables to complex troubleshooting tasks. Our projects are varied, encompassing everything from new construction sites to existing infrastructure upgrades. You'll be part of a dynamic team structure, working under the guidance of experienced supervisors while collaborating with project managers and engineers. At JP Electric, there's significant growth potential, with opportunities to advance into supervisory roles or specialize further in the fiber optics domain.

## Core Fiber Optics Technician Responsibilities

As a Fiber Optics Technician, your primary responsibilities include installing, terminating, and testing fiber optic cables in commercial and industrial environments. You will perform splicing of single-mode and multi-mode fibers using fusion splicers and route and secure fiber optic cables within conduits, trays, and overhead systems, ensuring compliance with site standards. Conducting OTDR testing and troubleshooting to ensure signal integrity and performance is crucial. Collaborating with project managers, engineers, and other trades to integrate fiber optic systems with network infrastructure is another key responsibility. You'll maintain detailed documentation of splicing, testing, and installation activities for client records and compliance, ensuring installations are clean, organized, and meet industry best practices.

### Advanced Technical Duties

- Conduct advanced OTDR analysis and interpret results to optimize network performance.
- Integrate state-of-the-art fiber optic technologies in complex multi-site projects.
- Implement and manage cross-connection and fiber distribution hubs for large-scale deployments.
- Lead technical workshops and training sessions for junior technicians.

### Regional Project Specifics

Our projects in Franklin and the surrounding areas, including Spring Hill and Nolensville, often involve large-scale commercial developments and municipal infrastructure upgrades, offering unique challenges and learning opportunities.

### Safety Protocols

Safety is paramount at JP Electric. Technicians must adhere to strict safety protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as hard hats, safety glasses, and gloves. Regular safety training sessions ensure that all team members are up-to-date with the latest industry safety standards.

## Required Experience & Skills

We are looking for candidates with at least 3-5 years of experience as a Fiber Optics Technician. Candidates should have a strong background in fiber optic installations and splicing, proficiency with OTDR testing and troubleshooting, and a solid understanding of industry standards such as TIA/EIA. Attention to detail for cable routing and termination is essential, along with effective communication skills for team collaboration.

- OSHA 10 or 30-Hour Construction Safety certification

### Technical Knowledge

- Deep understanding of fiber optic transmission principles
- Familiarity with network infrastructure and integration
- Knowledge of advanced fusion splicing techniques

## Tools & Equipment

Our Fiber Optics Technicians use a variety of tools daily, including fusion splicers, OTDRs, fiber optic test kits, and cable slitters. While technicians are expected to provide personal hand tools, JP Electric supplies advanced equipment such as power meters and light sources to support your work.

## Physical Requirements

The role requires the ability to lift up to 50 pounds regularly, work in confined spaces, and operate in various environmental conditions. Safety gear, including steel-toed boots, gloves, and protective eyewear, is mandatory.
