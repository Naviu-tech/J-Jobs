## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician with IES Electric, you'll play a crucial role in our multi-year project in Modesto, CA, with additional projects in neighboring cities such as Turlock, Ceres, Ripon, and Manteca. Your expertise will be essential in installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting renewable energy systems for commercial properties. We keep it real here, so expect to dive right into the action, working alongside skilled engineers and project managers to deliver energy-efficient solutions. Your day-to-day tasks will have a direct impact on the success of our projects and the satisfaction of our clients.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Renewable Energy System Installation

Your main focus will be on installing renewable energy systems like solar panels, energy storage systems, and inverters. You'll be routing and installing conduit (EMT, rigid) and wiring for high-voltage DC and AC systems. This involves hands-on work, ensuring that each component is placed correctly and wired safely to meet the project's specifications.

### System Testing and Commissioning

Once the systems are installed, you'll perform rigorous testing and commissioning to ensure optimal energy output. This includes verifying system compliance with local regulations and troubleshooting any initial issues that arise. Your keen eye for detail will ensure that each solar array functions at peak efficiency.

### Collaboration and Maintenance

Working closely with engineers and project managers, you'll help design and implement energy-efficient electrical solutions tailored to each site's unique needs. You will also install and maintain battery energy storage systems (BESS), integrating them with building power systems. Regular preventive maintenance on renewable energy equipment will be part of your routine, where you'll replace faulty components and ensure proper grounding. Supervising apprentices and ensuring they adhere to safety standards and proper installation techniques will also be part of your duties.

### Additional Activities

Beyond these core tasks, your day may include preparing detailed reports on system performance and maintenance activities, attending team meetings to strategize project timelines, and updating your skills through ongoing training sessions. These activities keep you at the forefront of the industry and ensure our projects are consistently top-notch.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To thrive in this role, you must have a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations and at least four years of field experience. Your extensive knowledge of the NEC and renewable energy codes, including solar and battery storage regulations, is essential. You should have hands-on experience with solar panel installations, inverters, and high-voltage DC systems.

### Key Skills and Abilities

- Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters
- Ability to read and interpret blueprints, electrical schematics, and energy system diagrams
- Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail for troubleshooting and optimizing systems

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $33.06-$38.08 per hour, depending on experience. At IES Electric, we believe in fostering career growth, providing ample opportunities for advancement and ongoing training. You'll benefit from continuous education and certification programs designed to enhance your skills and keep you ahead in the industry. Join us to be part of a dynamic team that values expertise and dedication, ensuring your efforts are rewarded both professionally and personally.
