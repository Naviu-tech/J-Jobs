## What You'll Do as an Electrician

As an Electrician at Vision Technologies in Sandy Springs, GA, you'll be the backbone of our electrical projects. With a strong focus on commercial installations, you'll be involved in setting up electrical systems that power our client's operations. Our current projects range from office buildings to retail spaces, where your expertise in electrical work will ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. This is not just about wiring buildings; it's about bringing a space to life with reliable and safe electrical systems.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician

Each day, you'll immerse yourself in the essential tasks that keep our projects on track. Your morning might start with reviewing blueprints to plan the installation of switchgear, panels, and transformers. You'll measure, cut, bend, and install EMT and rigid conduit, ensuring everything aligns with project specifications. As the day progresses, you'll pull and terminate wires within conduits and boxes, ensuring they are secure and connections are tidy.

In addition to these core tasks, you'll install and wire lighting fixtures, outlets, and power circuits, bringing light and power to new spaces. Troubleshooting is a key part of your role; using tools like multimeters, you'll test circuits and components to diagnose and resolve issues quickly. Collaboration is also crucial, as you'll work alongside other trades to coordinate and complete installations within timelines.

Beyond installations, you will perform routine activities such as maintaining organized and clean work areas, conducting safety checks, and ensuring compliance with safety standards. You might also participate in daily safety briefings and update project logs to document your progress.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician

To excel in this role, you'll need proficiency with conduit benders and a variety of power tools. A deep understanding of NEC codes is essential, as is the ability to work on lifts and scaffolding safely. Strong troubleshooting skills will help you navigate complex problems, and experience with lighting control systems will be advantageous. Additionally, you'll have the leadership capabilities to mentor apprentices, guiding the next generation of electricians.

We require 3-5 years of hands-on experience in the field as an Electrician. Must-have skills include the ability to read and interpret blueprints accurately, excellent hand-eye coordination, and a strong focus on safety and compliance. Your attention to detail and commitment to high-quality work will set you apart.
