## What You'll Do as an Electrical Foreman

As an Electrical Foreman at Collins Electrical, you'll be at the forefront of our exciting multi-year project in Cypress, CA, and potentially extend your expertise to nearby cities like Los Alamitos, Garden Grove, and Buena Park. Your role will be pivotal in managing and executing electrical operations, particularly focusing on the installation and maintenance of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. We value straightforward communication, and in this role, you'll be leading a dynamic team, ensuring that every task aligns with project designs, safety protocols, and deadlines.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrical Foreman

### Lead and Manage Field Operations

You'll oversee the installation of commercial electrical systems, including service panels, transformers, and EV charging equipment. Your leadership will ensure that journeymen and apprentices are effectively allocated tasks, enhancing crew productivity while upholding safety standards. Each day, you'll engage in hands-on tasks such as conduit bending, wire pulling, and terminations, ensuring compliance with the NEC and California Electric Code standards. 

### Troubleshoot and Collaborate

Your technical skills will come into play as you troubleshoot and resolve electrical issues, utilizing tools like multimeters and megohmmeters for diagnostics. You'll be the go-to leader on-site, providing coaching and mentoring to team members, while maintaining an organized and clean job site. Collaboration with project managers, clients, and other trades will be crucial in resolving any field challenges, ensuring seamless project execution.

### Documentation and Safety Management

Maintaining daily reports on project progress, labor hours, and material usage will be part of your routine. You'll conduct regular safety meetings, enforce safety protocols, and use your authority to halt work if unsafe conditions arise. Managing material orders and inventory, while adhering to project schedules, will also be key aspects of your role. Additionally, you'll often engage in customer interactions to ensure their needs and expectations are being met.

## What You Need to Be an Electrical Foreman

### Essential Qualifications and Experience

To thrive in this role, you'll need an active and valid journeyman electrician certification from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). Ideally, you should have 5-7 years of experience in commercial electrical work, with at least 2 years in a leadership capacity. A deep understanding of NEC and California Electric Code, combined with hands-on experience in EV charging station installations, is essential.

### Skills and Certifications

Proficiency in conduit bending, wire termination, and troubleshooting electrical systems is a must. Strong leadership and communication skills are crucial, as you'll be managing and mentoring field teams. A valid driver's license with a clean record is required. While not mandatory, having OSHA 30-hour certification and First Aid/CPR is preferred. Familiarity with construction management software, like Site Tracker, will be advantageous.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $48.88-$58.89 per hour, depending on experience. At Collins Electrical, you'll find ample career advancement opportunities, along with ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the cutting edge of your field. Our comprehensive benefits package is designed to support your professional growth and personal well-being, making Collins Electrical a rewarding place to build your career as an Electrical Foreman.
