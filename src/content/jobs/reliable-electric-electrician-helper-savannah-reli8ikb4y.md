## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician Helper

This includes carrying materials, tools, and equipment to designated work areas, ensuring that job sites remain organized and clean at all times.

You'll frequently help pull wires and cables through conduits and walls under supervision, supporting the installation of lighting fixtures, outlets, and switchgear. Your tasks will also include performing basic yet essential duties such as drilling holes, mounting boxes, and labeling wires. Additionally, you'll be responsible for preparing tools and materials needed for each task, following detailed instructions from our experienced electricians.
