As a Journeyman Electrician at Primoris, you'll be a vital part of our team working on a multi-year hospital construction project in Barstow, CA, with additional projects in the neighboring cities of Victorville, Apple Valley, and Hesperia. Your role is crucial in ensuring that all electrical systems are installed and maintained to the highest standards, keeping everything running safely and efficiently. You'll be working hands-on with a variety of electrical systems, specifically tailored to meet the demands of healthcare facilities. This is a real-world position where practical skills and safety are paramount.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Install and Maintain Complex Electrical Systems

Your day-to-day tasks will involve installing and maintaining complex electrical systems across new hospital projects. This includes wiring patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units. You'll work with EMT and rigid conduit, routing and bending them to support high-density wiring requirements for medical-grade equipment.

### Ensure Compliance and Safety

Ensuring proper grounding and bonding of all systems is crucial, and you'll be responsible for compliance with the National Electrical Code (NEC) and hospital-specific codes. Collaborating with engineers and medical equipment specialists, you'll ensure power systems meet design specifications and safety standards.

### Perform Critical Electrical Calculations and Installations

You'll perform load calculations, install service equipment, emergency power systems, and backup generators. Your role also includes troubleshooting and testing critical electrical systems, such as fire alarm circuits, nurse call systems, and life safety equipment.

To qualify for this position, you must hold a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations. You should have at least 5+ years of hands-on experience in the field, with extensive knowledge of the NEC and healthcare-specific electrical standards. Experience with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits is essential.

### Must-Have Skills

- Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters.
- Strong communication skills to collaborate effectively with diverse teams in high-pressure environments.
