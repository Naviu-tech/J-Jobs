As a Journeyman Electrician at Oak Electrical, you'll be diving into the heart of our ambitious multi-year projects in Round Rock, TX. Our primary focus is on new hospital construction projects, which require meticulous attention to detail and adherence to stringent electrical codes. You'll be a crucial part of a team that's dedicated to ensuring the safety and reliability of electrical systems in healthcare environments. Beyond Round Rock, you may also have opportunities to work on projects in neighboring cities such as Georgetown, Cedar Park, and Pflugerville. Your daily tasks will revolve around complex electrical systems, making sure that everything is installed to perfection and functions seamlessly.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Hospital Construction Projects

You'll be at the forefront of installing and maintaining complex electrical systems in new hospital structures. This includes working on patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units where precision is paramount. You'll need to adeptly route, bend, and install conduit (EMT and rigid) to support the high-density wiring requirements essential for medical-grade equipment.

### System Compliance and Collaboration

Ensuring proper grounding and bonding of all systems in compliance with NEC and hospital-specific codes will be a daily task. Collaboration is key; you'll work closely with engineers and medical equipment specialists to ensure that power systems meet both design specifications and safety standards.

### Load Calculations and Emergency Systems

Performing load calculations and installing service equipment, emergency power systems, and backup generators are crucial elements of your role. You'll supervise apprentices, ensuring they adhere to safety protocols and deliver quality workmanship. Troubleshooting and testing critical electrical systems, such as fire alarm circuits, nurse call systems, and life safety equipment, will also be part of your routine.

### Additional Daily Activities

- Conduct routine inspections to ensure all electrical components are functioning properly and safely.
- Maintain detailed records of all installations, repairs, and maintenance activities.
- Provide input on project planning to improve efficiency and effectiveness of electrical installations.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To excel in this role, you must possess extensive knowledge of NEC electrical standards and have hands-on experience with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits. You should be proficient in reading and interpreting complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals. Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters is essential for troubleshooting and ensuring system integrity.

### Must-Have Skills

- A minimum of 5 years of experience working as a Journeyman Electrician.
- Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate with diverse teams in high-pressure environments.
- Exceptional problem-solving skills and a keen eye for detail in ensuring high-quality installations.
