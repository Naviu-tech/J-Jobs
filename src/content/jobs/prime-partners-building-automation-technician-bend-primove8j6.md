## What You'll Do as a Building Automation Technician

As a Building Automation Technician at Prime Partners, you'll be at the heart of ensuring our projects in Bend and surrounding areas like Redmond, Sisters, and La Pine run smoothly and efficiently. You’ll dive deep into the systems that keep buildings running optimally. This multi-year venture requires precision and expertise in building automation, focusing on programming, commissioning, and troubleshooting systems. Your role is vital in maintaining the seamless operation of our facilities, ensuring every system works harmoniously.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Building Automation Technician

As part of your daily routine, you'll program, commission, and troubleshoot building automation systems. This involves configuring Direct Digital Control (DDC) systems for HVAC and other mechanical systems, ensuring they operate efficiently. You'll be working closely with project managers to make sure everything stays on track and within budget. A typical day may include:

- **On-Site Troubleshooting:** You'll conduct on-site troubleshooting to address any issues with control systems and mechanical integration. This requires a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach to problem-solving.
- **Documentation and Record Maintenance:** Keeping accurate project records is crucial. You'll document installation processes and maintain precise records to ensure compliance and facilitate future troubleshooting.
- **Effective Communication:** You'll engage with supervisors, team members, and clients to communicate system updates and project progress while adhering to safety protocols and regulatory compliance.

## What You Need to Be a Building Automation Technician

To thrive in this role, you'll need hands-on experience with systems like Niagara, Tridium, Distech, Alerton, or JCI Metasys. A strong proficiency in troubleshooting electrical and networking systems is essential. Here’s what we’re looking for:

- **Experience:** 2-7 years in the field as a Building Automation Technician.
- **Technical Skills:** Familiarity with HVAC operations and DDC systems is a must. You should be able to read and interpret electrical diagrams with ease.
- **Communication Skills:** Strong verbal and written communication skills are necessary for effective teamwork and client interaction.
- **Physical Requirements:** The ability to lift up to 50 pounds and work on construction sites is required.

## Compensation
