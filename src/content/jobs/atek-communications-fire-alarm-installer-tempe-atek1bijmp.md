At Atek Communications, we're on the hunt for a Fire Alarm Installer to join our team in Tempe, AZ. You'll be diving into some exciting commercial new construction projects not just in Tempe, but also in neighboring cities like Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Mesa. Your expertise will help us build and maintain top-notch fire alarm systems that keep our clients safe. We're all about getting the job done right and having a good time doing it.

## Key Responsibilities

You'll be installing fire alarm control panels and devices, pulling and terminating cables, mounting notification appliances, and getting hands-on with system programming and testing. Keeping detailed wiring documentation is key, and you'll be coordinating with other trades to make sure everything's placed just right. You'll also be troubleshooting any wiring issues that pop up and assisting with final testing and inspections. In the Tempe area, you might find yourself working on the new Tempe Gateway Project, so experience with large-scale installations is a plus. And don't forget, Arizona requires a clean background check and drug screening, so be ready for that.

## Required Qualifications

We're looking for someone with 1-3 years of experience working with commercial fire alarm systems. You should be a whiz at reading blueprints and familiar with NFPA 72 requirements and fire alarm circuit types. Knowing your way around a multimeter and testing equipment is a must, and attention to detail in documentation is crucial. Since you’ll be working around Tempe, having some local knowledge of regional electrical codes will give you a leg up.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary ranging from $24.51 to $32.22 per hour, depending on your experience. Plus, you'll get comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We're big on career advancement, so there are plenty of opportunities to grow with us. Ongoing training and certifications are also part of the package, so you’ll keep sharpening your skills as you go.

If this sounds like the next step in your career, we'd love to hear from you!
