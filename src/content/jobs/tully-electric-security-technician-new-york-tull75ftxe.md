Join us at Tully Electric as a Security Technician, right in the bustling heart of New York, NY, where you'll be part of a team dedicated to implementing and maintaining top-tier security solutions. Our office is just a quick trip away from neighboring cities like Jersey City, Hoboken, and Yonkers, and we’re looking for someone who’s ready to dive into the fast-paced world of enterprise security. You'll have the chance to work with cutting-edge technology, from video surveillance to access control systems, all while ensuring our clients’ peace of mind.

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you’ll be the go-to expert for designing and implementing enterprise-level security systems. You’ll configure IP camera networks, including those tricky VLANs and QoS settings, and program databases for access control and credential management. Your work will also involve installing biometric security devices and configuring cloud-based security platforms. We’ll rely on you to perform regular system health monitoring and maintenance, and you’ll get to integrate these security systems with building automation.

Additionally, you’ll need to stay on top of regional requirements, like ensuring compliance with New York’s specific security codes and standards. You’ll also engage in projects that may require after-hours support, ensuring everything runs smoothly even outside the typical 9-to-5. Plus, you’ll be the friendly face providing end-user training on system operation.

## Required Qualifications

To hit the ground running, you will need an ESA Level 1 certification and a clean background check. While CompTIA Security+ is preferred, it’s your demonstrated experience with enterprise video management systems that will really shine. A strong grasp of IP networking and cybersecurity is essential, along with proficiency in access control database management. We’d love it if you have experience with biometric security systems and a solid understanding of structured cabling standards.

New York-specific qualifications are also key; 1-3 years of experience in commercial security work is a must. Familiarity with local building codes and regulations will put you a step ahead, and your proven customer service skills will help you manage the unique demands of the Big Apple.

## Compensation & Benefits

We offer a competitive salary range of $26.19 to $34.92 per hour, depending on your experience, along with comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage. Enjoy paid time off and holidays, and take advantage of our career advancement opportunities. We’re committed to your growth, offering ongoing training and certifications to keep you at the forefront of the security industry.

If you’re ready to make your mark in New York’s dynamic security landscape, we’d love to hear from you!
