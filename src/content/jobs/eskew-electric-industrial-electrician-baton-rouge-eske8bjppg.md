Welcome to Eskew Electric in Baton Rouge, LA! We're on the lookout for a skilled Industrial Electrician to join our team and bring your expertise to our exciting projects. You'll be working in the heart of Baton Rouge, with the vibrant communities of Denham Springs, Central, and Zachary just a short drive away. If you're passionate about automation and process control, and you're ready to make a real impact, we want to hear from you!

## Key Responsibilities
In this role, you'll be diving into programming and troubleshooting Allen Bradley and Siemens PLCs. Commissioning automated production lines and performing root cause analysis on system failures will be your bread and butter. You'll also get to flex your skills in predictive maintenance using vibration analysis and thermal imaging. Designing and installing complex motor control circuits, managing electrical spare parts inventory, and training apprentices on industrial systems are just a few of the tasks you'll tackle. Plus, you'll coordinate with equipment manufacturers for complex repairs and develop SOPs for maintenance tasks. Power quality analysis and harmonic mitigation? You'll be all over that too! In the Baton Rouge area, you'll also need to be familiar with local codes and standards, work on projects in the petrochemical industry, and have a knack for Cajun-style problem-solving.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with advanced certification in Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC programming, and a solid background in industrial networking protocols like EtherNet/IP and Profibus. You should be a whiz with VFD programming and troubleshooting, and comfortable with thermal imaging and vibration analysis equipment. If you can read and create AutoCAD electrical drawings and have experience with SCADA systems and HMI programming, that's a big plus. Proven leadership skills in a maintenance environment are crucial, as is an understanding of IEEE standards for industrial power quality. You need at least 5 years of experience in a Journeyman role in an industrial setting. In Baton Rouge, we're looking for someone familiar with local energy regulations and who has experience in the petrochemical sector.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary range of $40.52-$44.27 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We're big on career advancement, so there are plenty of opportunities for growth. Plus, you'll have access to ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp.

If you're ready to bring your expertise to Eskew Electric and make waves in Baton Rouge, we can't wait to meet you!
