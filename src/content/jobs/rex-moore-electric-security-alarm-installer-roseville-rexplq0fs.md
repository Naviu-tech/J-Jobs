## What You'll Do as a Security Alarm Installer

As a Security Alarm Installer at Rex Moore Electric, your primary responsibility will be to ensure the safety and security of both residential and small business properties in and around Roseville, CA. Our projects span across Roseville, as well as neighboring cities such as Rocklin, Citrus Heights, and Folsom. This multi-year project offers a stable and engaging work environment with ample opportunities for growth. You'll be at the forefront of installation and configuration of state-of-the-art security systems, making a tangible difference in the safety of our clients' homes and businesses.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Security Alarm Installer

Each day as a Security Alarm Installer, you will be tasked with installing and configuring security alarm systems, which includes setting up sensors, control panels, and communication modules. You will work on both residential properties and small businesses, ensuring each alarm system is tailored to the specific needs of the client. Testing system functionality is a crucial part of your role to confirm that all components operate correctly. You'll address any issues that arise during installation and make necessary adjustments.

Programming alarm systems to meet customer specifications is another key responsibility. This includes setting up remote access features and integrating monitoring services. Routine maintenance tasks like battery replacements and firmware updates will also be part of your daily activities, ensuring all systems remain in optimal working condition. Additionally, you will spend time educating customers on system operation, helping them understand and manage their security systems effectively.

## What You Need to Be a Security Alarm Installer

To excel in this role, you'll need experience with low-voltage wiring and a solid understanding of basic electronics. The ability to work independently and solve problems during installations and service calls is crucial. Customer service skills are imperative to ensure client satisfaction and to assist customers in understanding their security systems. You should be familiar with common hand tools and diagnostic equipment, and comfortable working in both indoor and outdoor environments. A valid driverâ€™s license is necessary, as you'll be traveling between job sites in Roseville and its neighboring cities. Ideally, you should have 1-3 years of experience in the field as a Security Alarm Installer.
