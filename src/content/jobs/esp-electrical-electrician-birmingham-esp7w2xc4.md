Hey there! We're ESP Electrical, and we're on the hunt for an Industrial Apprentice Electrician to join our fantastic team in Birmingham, AL. If you're ready to work in a city known for its rich history and vibrant community, surrounded by places like Hoover, Vestavia Hills, and Homewood, this could be the perfect fit for you. We specialize in automated manufacturing systems and need someone who's as passionate about electrical work as we are. 

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be diving into tasks like installing and terminating 480V 3-phase power distribution systems and performing precise conduit bending for those complex industrial applications. You'll also assist with VFD and motor control installations and conduct preventive maintenance on manufacturing equipment. We count on you to use digital multimeters and meggars for testing and to maintain detailed maintenance logs. Plus, you'll support PLC cabinet assembly and follow confined space and elevated work procedures. In the Birmingham area, we also need you to assist with local electrical code compliance, collaborate with nearby utility companies, and participate in regional safety workshops. 

## Required Qualifications
For this role, you'll need your OSHA-30 certification and the ability to interpret industrial electrical blueprints and P&IDs. Demonstrated knowledge of motor control circuits is crucial, along with experience using conduit bending machines up to 2". You'll need proficiency with digital testing equipment and strong mathematical skills for load calculations. In this part of Alabama, 1-3 years of experience in an industrial setting is the norm. We're also looking for someone familiar with Birmingham's local electrical codes and someone who can easily navigate the city's industrial landscape.

## Compensation & Benefits
We're offering a competitive salary range of $23.95-$31.74 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in career advancement opportunities and provide ongoing training and certifications to help you grow. 

If you're ready to take on this exciting opportunity with ESP Electrical, we'd love to hear from you!
