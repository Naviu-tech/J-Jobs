## What You'll Do as a Motor Mechanic

Welcome to Burdett Hill, where we have an exciting opportunity for skilled Motor Mechanics on a multi-year project in Tyner, NC. As a Motor Mechanic, your role is pivotal in ensuring the smooth operation of our heavy-duty machinery. Our projects are not only focused in Tyner but also extend to nearby areas like Hertford, Edenton, and Elizabeth City. We rely on your expertise to keep our equipment running efficiently and safely across these locations.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Motor Mechanic

Your day-to-day work will involve disassembling, inspecting, troubleshooting, and reassembling motors, pumps, and generators, with power ratings up to 12,000 HP. You'll diagnose issues such as oil leaks and vibrations and determine the necessary repairs. After repairs, you'll perform test runs to ensure everything is functioning properly.

Collaboration is key; you'll work closely with machinists and quality control technicians to ensure all machinery meets project specifications. Maintaining accurate records of all work completed is also an essential part of your role. Additionally, you may find yourself conducting routine maintenance checks, replacing worn-out parts, and staying updated with the latest industry standards and techniques to enhance your efficiency and effectiveness on the job.

## What You Need to Be a Motor Mechanic

To thrive in this role, you must have at least 5 years of experience in disassembling and repairing motors and generators. A high school diploma or equivalent is required, along with the ability to read and interpret technical drawings. You'll need to bring your own set of tools to the job site and possess excellent communication skills to liaise effectively with team members.

Physical fitness is important, as you'll need to lift up to 50 pounds and be prepared to work extended hours, including weekends and holidays. Hands-on abilities such as precision in handling tools, problem-solving skills, and a keen eye for detail will serve you well in this role.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $31.01-$32.65 per hour, depending on your experience. At Burdett Hill, we value growth and provide career advancement opportunities to help you reach your professional goals. Ongoing training and certifications are available to keep your skills sharp and up-to-date.

In addition to financial compensation, we offer key benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. We are committed to supporting our Motor Mechanics in their career paths, providing the resources necessary to excel in their roles and beyond.
