You'll engage in tasks that are both challenging and rewarding, offering a dynamic work environment where no two days are the same.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Complex System Installation and Maintenance

You'll be responsible for installing and maintaining intricate electrical systems within newly constructed hospital facilities. This includes wiring patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units, all of which demand precision and adherence to strict safety standards. Your work will support the deployment of essential medical-grade equipment.

### Conduit Work and System Grounding

A significant part of your day will involve routing, bending, and installing conduits (EMT, rigid) to accommodate high-density wiring. Ensuring proper grounding and bonding of systems per NEC and specific hospital codes will be a priority, safeguarding both equipment and personnel.

### Collaboration and Supervision

Working closely with engineers and medical equipment specialists, you'll ensure power systems meet design specifications and safety standards. As a supervisor to apprentices, you'll guide them in following safety protocols and achieving high-quality work. This collaborative environment will require you to balance leadership with hands-on tasks.

Performing load calculations and installing service equipment, emergency power systems, and backup generators will also be part of your routine. Additionally, you'll engage in daily tasks such as performing system upgrades and conducting preventive maintenance checks.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

### Extensive Technical Knowledge

To succeed in this role, you'll need an extensive understanding of NEC electrical standards and experience with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits. Your ability to read and interpret complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals will be essential.

### Hands-On Expertise

Proficiency with diagnostic tools, including multimeters and megohmmeters, is a must-have. Strong communication skills are crucial, as you'll be working in diverse teams and under high-pressure conditions. A minimum of 5+ years of experience in the field as a Journeyman Electrician is required, demonstrating your ability to handle complex projects and tasks effectively.
