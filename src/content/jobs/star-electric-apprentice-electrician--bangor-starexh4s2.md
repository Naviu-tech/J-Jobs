## About Our Apprentice Electrician Team

Working as an Apprentice Electrician at Star Electric means becoming part of a dynamic and reputable team known for excellence in the Bangor area. Our commitment to quality workmanship and innovation has made us a leader in the electrical contracting industry. Our projects are diverse, ranging from residential to large-scale commercial ventures. We extend our services beyond Bangor, reaching into surrounding cities such as Brewer, Orono, Hampden, and Old Town. Our Apprentice Electricians are integral to our success, consistently delivering reliable and efficient electrical solutions.

## The Apprentice Electrician Position

As an Apprentice Electrician on our team, you will embark on a journey of learning and professional growth. Your day-to-day will involve hands-on work, where you'll support the installation of cutting-edge electrical systems. You'll find yourself working in a variety of settings, from bustling construction sites to serene residential projects. Our team structure promotes collaboration, with experienced electricians providing mentorship and guidance. At Star Electric, there is significant room for growth; many of our apprentices transition into journeyman positions and beyond, supported by our robust career development programs.

## Core Apprentice Electrician Responsibilities

Your role will be pivotal in supporting the installation of rooftop solar arrays, battery systems, and EV chargers on commercial properties. You'll assist in running and securing conduit for DC wiring from solar modules to inverters, performing tasks such as terminating PV modules and connecting battery storage systems. Under supervision, you'll learn to test and troubleshoot solar inverters and monitoring systems. You'll also coordinate material preparation, ensuring tools are organized and pre-assembling racking systems. Safety is paramount; you'll follow stringent procedures for rooftop work, utilizing fall protection equipment.

In addition to these core tasks, you'll engage in advanced technical duties, such as:
- Assisting in the configuration and programming of smart inverters and energy management systems.
- Participating in detailed site assessments and layout planning for optimal solar array placement.
- Supporting the integration of renewable systems into existing electrical infrastructure.
- Engaging in regional projects that require travel to nearby cities, adapting to varied project scopes and environments.

## Required Experience & Skills

To join our team, you should have a solid understanding of basic electrical principles, especially those involving DC power systems. You must be willing to work outdoors on rooftops in diverse weather conditions and be adept at following technical instructions for assembling and wiring renewable energy systems. Strong organizational skills are necessary for effective material handling and job site preparation. Comfort with hand tools and basic testing equipment is essential.

- A minimum of 1-4 years of experience as an Apprentice Electrician.
- Essential certifications include OSHA 10, a valid driver's license, and an electrical apprentice license.
- Technical knowledge in photovoltaic systems and battery storage solutions is highly desirable.

## Tools & Equipment

Daily, our Apprentice Electricians utilize an array of tools, including wire strippers, multimeters, conduit benders, and power drills. While personal tools such as screwdrivers and pliers are expected, Star Electric provides specialized equipment like fall protection harnesses and solar testing devices to ensure safety and efficiency.

## Physical Requirements

The role involves physical demands, such as lifting items up to 50 pounds. You'll work in various conditions, from hot rooftops to cold outdoor sites, requiring adaptability and resilience. Safety gear, including hard hats, safety glasses, and gloves, is mandatory to ensure your well-being on the job.

## Training & Development

Our Apprentice Electrician mentorship program pairs you with seasoned electricians who will guide your development. You'll have access to certifications in solar energy and advanced electrical systems, enhancing your skill set. Star Electric offers a clear career advancement path, with opportunities to progress to journeyman and master electrician levels.

## Compensation Package

We offer a competitive salary range of $19.44-$23.43 per hour, commensurate with experience. Our compensation package includes career advancement opportunities, ongoing training, and certifications to further your career. Overtime policies are favorable, and we provide tool allowances to support your work. Additional perks include health benefits, paid time off, and company-sponsored events that foster a sense of community and appreciation.
