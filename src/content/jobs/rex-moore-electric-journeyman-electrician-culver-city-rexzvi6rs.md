## The Journeyman Electrician Position

As a Journeyman Electrician with Rex Moore Electric, you will play a crucial role in our multi-year projects in Culver City and beyond. Your day-to-day responsibilities will encompass installing, maintaining, and repairing intricate electrical systems in environments that range from new hospital constructions to high-end commercial buildings. You'll be working in a dynamic team structure, often leading smaller crews under the supervision of a Senior Journeyman or Project Manager. With Rex Moore Electric, there is significant growth potential. We offer pathways to advance into specialized roles or supervisory positions, ensuring your career development aligns with your aspirations.

## Core Journeyman Electrician Responsibilities

Your primary duties will involve installing and maintaining complex electrical systems in new hospital construction projects, such as patient rooms, operating theaters, and critical care units. You will route, bend, and install conduit (EMT, rigid) to support high-density wiring requirements for medical-grade equipment. Ensuring proper grounding and bonding of all systems in compliance with NEC and hospital-specific codes is critical. Collaboration with engineers and medical equipment specialists will be essential to ensure power systems meet design specifications and safety standards. You will perform load calculations and install service equipment, emergency power systems, and backup generators. Supervision of apprentices will also be part of your role, ensuring adherence to safety protocols and quality workmanship. Advanced technical duties include:

- Installation of advanced lighting control systems and energy management solutions.
- Integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar power systems, into existing frameworks.
- Implementation of building automation systems for enhanced operational efficiency.
- Managing electrical system upgrades in compliance with regional project specifics.

Adherence to safety protocols is paramount, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and following OSHA and Rex Moore Electricâ€™s safety guidelines.

## Required Experience & Skills

To qualify for this position, you must possess a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations. You should have extensive knowledge of NEC and healthcare-specific electrical standards, with at least 5+ years of experience as a Journeyman Electrician. Experience with emergency power systems, backup generators, and life safety circuits is essential. You must be proficient in reading and interpreting complex blueprints, electrical schematics, and technical manuals. Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters is required. Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate with diverse teams in high-pressure environments are crucial.

Rex Moore Electric provides company-specific equipment like power drills, saws, and PPE.

## Physical Requirements

The role requires physical stamina and the ability to lift up to 50 pounds regularly. You will work in various conditions, from outdoor sites to confined indoor spaces, often requiring prolonged periods of standing, bending, and kneeling. Safety gear, including hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-toed boots, is mandatory.
