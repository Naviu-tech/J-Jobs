You'll be at the forefront of installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting cutting-edge renewable energy systems for commercial properties. This role is hands-on, and you'll be deeply involved in ensuring that our projects run smoothly and efficiently. Your work will help power the future sustainably, all while collaborating with a skilled team in a dynamic setting.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

Your day-to-day responsibilities will include installing and maintaining solar panels, energy storage systems, and inverters. You'll expertly route and install conduit (EMT, rigid) and wiring for high-voltage DC and AC systems. Testing and commissioning solar arrays will be a part of your routine, ensuring optimal energy output and compliance with local regulations. Working closely with engineers and project managers, you'll design and implement energy-efficient electrical solutions. You'll also install and maintain battery energy storage systems (BESS), integrating them seamlessly with building power systems.

Preventive maintenance will be part of your daily tasks, including replacing faulty components and ensuring proper grounding of renewable energy equipment. You'll supervise apprentices, ensuring they adhere to safety standards and proper installation techniques. Preparing detailed reports on system performance and maintenance activities will also be a key aspect of your role. Additionally, you'll conduct routine checks to ensure the integrity of all installed systems, provide on-the-spot troubleshooting, and ensure compliance with safety protocols.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To excel in this role, you must possess a valid California Journeyman Certification from the Department of Industrial Relations. You'll need extensive knowledge of NEC and renewable energy codes, particularly those related to solar and battery storage regulations. Hands-on experience with solar panel installations, inverters, and high-voltage DC systems is essential. Proficiency with diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters is required. You should be adept at reading and interpreting blueprints, electrical schematics, and energy system diagrams. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail are crucial for troubleshooting and optimizing systems. A minimum of 4 years in the field as a Journeyman Electrician is required, along with a focus on practical, hands-on abilities.
