## Your Daily Tasks as a Switchgear Technician

### Installation and Maintenance

Each day, you'll install, maintain, and test various low and medium voltage switchgear systems. This will require you to read and interpret technical diagrams and schematics to ensure precise installation. You’ll be responsible for calibrating and adjusting equipment to meet operational requirements.

### Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving

A significant part of your day will involve troubleshooting and resolving technical problems both in the shop and on-site. Whether it’s identifying a faulty circuit or addressing unexpected equipment failures, your problem-solving skills will be crucial. You'll also conduct routine inspections to preemptively address potential issues before they escalate.

### Certifications and Skills

While NETA or NICET certifications are preferred, they are not mandatory. However, the ability to travel frequently and work at heights is essential. You must possess strong organizational and communication skills to manage your tasks efficiently and work effectively with team members and clients.

### Hands-On Abilities

Key skills include the ability to perform detailed inspections, conduct tests, and execute repairs. Your ability to think on your feet and adapt to changing conditions will be invaluable. Practical experience with the tools and techniques used in switchgear maintenance is a must-have.
