## What You'll Do as a Machinist

As a Machinist at Burdett Hill, you will be an integral part of our multi-year project in Carrsville, VA, with additional work in neighboring cities such as Franklin, Smithfield, and Suffolk. Your role is pivotal in manufacturing and repairing high-precision components essential for our construction and maintenance projects. You'll be getting your hands dirty with a variety of machines, ensuring that all parts meet our strict quality standards. This isn't just about operating machines; it's about crafting the pieces that keep our projects moving forward.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Machinist

Your day-to-day responsibilities will include manufacturing and repairing parts according to detailed specifications and drawings. You'll operate a range of precision machinery, including milling machines, lathes, boring mills, and grinders. 

- **Precision Machining**: You will be responsible for creating components with tolerances as tight as .0005” to .001”. This requires a keen eye for detail and a steady hand.
  
- **Inspection and Quality Control**: Regular inspections of manufactured components are crucial. You'll ensure that each piece meets our exacting standards before it moves on to the next stage of production.

- **Rigging and Crane Operations**: Safely handling rigging and operating overhead cranes will be part of your routine, ensuring the safe movement of heavy components.

To join our team, you'll need a high school diploma or equivalent, along with a minimum of 5 years of experience in machining with a focus on close tolerances. Your ability to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing is crucial, as is the physical capability to lift up to 50 pounds and work overtime, including weekends and holidays, as required.

- **Technical Skills**: Proficiency in reading and interpreting blueprints and technical drawings is a must. You should be comfortable with various machining tools and have a solid understanding of safety protocols.

- **Problem-Solving Abilities**: Quick thinking and the ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues on the fly are essential in this fast-paced environment.

- **Attention to Detail**: Precision is key, and your ability to focus on the minutiae will ensure the quality and reliability of our products.
