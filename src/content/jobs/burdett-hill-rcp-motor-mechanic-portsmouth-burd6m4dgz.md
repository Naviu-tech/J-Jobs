Welcome to Burdett Hill, where we're embarking on a multi-year construction project in Portsmouth, VA, with exciting opportunities extending to nearby cities like Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Suffolk.

This is a hands-on position where you'll be tackling everything from troubleshooting to performing rigorous inspections. Your expertise will ensure the seamless operation of our equipment, critical to the success of our projects.

## Your Daily Tasks as a RCP Motor Mechanic

Your day will start with a safety briefing, ensuring all team members are aligned on the day's objectives and safety protocols. As a key player, you'll disassemble and reassemble vertical motors that can reach up to 12,000 HP and operate at 13.2 kV. 

One of your primary tasks will be performing incoming and outgoing inspections, where you'll meticulously assess the condition of motors and conduct test runs to ensure optimal functionality. Troubleshooting will be a significant part of your role, addressing issues such as oil leaks, vibrations, and other operational anomalies. Your keen eye for detail will be crucial in identifying and resolving these challenges efficiently.

In addition to these tasks, you'll be working with and around radioactive materials, adhering strictly to safety protocols to maintain a safe working environment.

You'll need at least 5 years of hands-on experience with motors and pumps, showcasing your deep understanding of these systems. Familiarity with rigging practices and the use of M&TE tools such as micrometers, calipers, and torque wrenches is a must.

A basic understanding of electrical systems will serve you well, as will the ability to complete Radiological Worker Training. Your strong attention to detail and strict adherence to safety standards will be vital in ensuring a safe and efficient workplace. These hands-on abilities will not only help you succeed but also contribute to the overall success of our projects.
