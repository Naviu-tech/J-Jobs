This position is ideal for someone who thrives in hands-on environments and takes pride in detailed and precise work.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Fire Alarm Installer

### Installation of Fire Alarm Systems

Your primary responsibility will be installing fire alarm systems in high-density commercial and industrial buildings. This involves running conduit and pulling fire-rated cables to support system installations. You will mount and connect control panels, notification devices, smoke detectors, and heat sensors to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### System Integration and Testing

Additionally, you will coordinate with HVAC and sprinkler contractors to integrate fire alarm systems into the overall building safety networks seamlessly.

### Maintenance and Documentation

Part of your role involves repairing or replacing faulty components to maintain system reliability. You will document installation details and system configurations diligently for both inspection purposes and customer records. Regular activities will also include troubleshooting system issues and performing routine system checks.

To be successful in this role, you'll need at least 3-5 years of experience as a Fire Alarm Installer. Your expertise in installing and maintaining fire alarm control panels and field devices is crucial. You should be skilled in pulling fire-rated wiring and connecting notification devices, as well as familiar with testing and troubleshooting tools for fire alarm systems.

### Technical Abilities

A strong ability to interpret building plans and system schematics for integration is essential. You should be capable of managing multiple installation projects simultaneously, often with tight deadlines. Your hands-on abilities will be complemented by a keen attention to detail and a commitment to safety standards.
