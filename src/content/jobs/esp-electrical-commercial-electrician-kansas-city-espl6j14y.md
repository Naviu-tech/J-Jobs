Join us at ESP Electrical in Kansas City, MO, where we're transforming the future of commercial construction with innovative electrical solutions. We're on the lookout for a talented Commercial Electrician to join our dynamic team. If you’re from around here, you know we’re in a bustling area surrounded by communities like Overland Park, Leawood, and Independence. We’re excited to work with someone who’s as passionate about electrical systems as we are, and who is eager to contribute to big, exciting projects in the Kansas City area.

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be diving into the heart of commercial construction, designing and installing electrical systems that keep things running smoothly. Your day will include calculating voltage drop and load requirements, and working closely with BIM modeling teams to resolve any hiccups. You’ll supervise the prefabrication of electrical assemblies and implement complex lighting control systems. Programming fire alarm systems and managing material logistics for large projects will be part of your routine. Plus, you’ll coordinate overhead rough-in with mechanical trades and perform startup and commissioning of building systems. And, of course, mentoring apprentices to pass on your knowledge is key. In Kansas City, you might also find yourself handling regional projects that require some local knowledge, such as understanding Missouri's specific energy codes and coordinating with local utility companies.

## Required Qualifications
To rock this role, you’ll need a Journeyman License, and extensive experience with lighting control systems like DALI and DMX. Your proven expertise in fire alarm installation and programming, along with your skill in using BIM software for coordination, will make you a great fit. We’re looking for someone with advanced knowledge of emergency power systems and certifications in multiple lift equipment types. Strong project management and leadership skills are essential, as is experience with green building requirements and energy codes. In Kansas City, having a good grasp of local construction standards and a minimum of 3-5 years of commercial Journeyman experience will set you up for success.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary range of $35.62-$40.11 per hour, depending on your experience. You’ll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in supporting your growth with career advancement opportunities and ongoing training and certifications. Come be a part of something big at ESP Electrical!
