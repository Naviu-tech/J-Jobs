Hey there! We're EZ Electric, and we're on the hunt for a talented Industrial Electrician to join our team here in Bismarck, ND. If you're passionate about automation and process control, and you're looking for an exciting opportunity to grow your skills, we might just be the perfect fit! Bismarck is a great place to work and live, surrounded by the beautiful cities of Mandan, Lincoln, and Washburn. We're a friendly bunch, and we can't wait to welcome someone who shares our commitment to top-notch electrical solutions.

## Key Responsibilities
You'll be hands-on with programming and troubleshooting Allen Bradley and Siemens PLCs, commissioning automated production lines, and diving into root cause analysis of system hiccups. Predictive maintenance is key, and you'll be using tools like vibration analysis and thermal imaging. Designing and installing complex motor control circuits will be part of your day-to-day, along with managing our electrical spare parts inventory. Training apprentices and coordinating with manufacturers for those tricky repairs will also be in your wheelhouse. Plus, you'll develop standard operating procedures for maintenance tasks and perform power quality analysis and harmonic mitigation.

In the Bismarck area, you'll also focus on adapting systems for local climate conditions, ensuring compliance with North Dakota safety regulations, and sometimes traveling to nearby cities for project support.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with advanced certification in Allen Bradley and Siemens PLC programming and a knack for industrial networking protocols like EtherNet/IP and Profibus. You'll need expertise in VFD programming and troubleshooting, and proficiency with thermal imaging and vibration analysis equipment. Reading and creating AutoCAD electrical drawings should be second nature to you. Experience with SCADA systems and HMI programming is essential, and we'd love to see demonstrated leadership skills in a maintenance environment. Familiarity with IEEE standards for industrial power quality is a must.

You'll need at least 5 years of Journeyman experience in an industrial setting. Additionally, we value knowledge of North Dakota's specific industrial compliance requirements and any local environmental considerations.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary ranging from $40.49 to $44.60 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays. We believe in career advancement opportunities and will support you with ongoing training and certifications.

If this sounds like your next adventure, weâ€™d love to hear from you! Join us at EZ Electric and be part of something electrifying.
