## What You'll Do as a Journeyman Electrician

As a Journeyman Electrician at EV GO, you will play a crucial role in our multi-year project in Laguna Beach, CA, with additional projects in nearby cities such as Newport Beach, Irvine, and San Clemente. Your primary focus will be on the installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of electrical systems specifically designed for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This is a hands-on, practical position where your expertise will directly contribute to the success of our projects and the satisfaction of our clients.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Journeyman Electrician

### Install and Maintain EV Charging Systems

Your day will often begin with reviewing project plans and electrical diagrams to plan your installations. You'll be responsible for installing service panels, transformers, and related components required for EV charging stations. This involves accurately measuring, cutting, and bending conduit (EMT, rigid) to ensure precise alignment, followed by pulling, labeling, and terminating wiring. Your work must adhere to the National Electrical Code (NEC) and California Electric Code standards.

### Troubleshoot and Test Electrical Systems

A significant part of your role will involve troubleshooting any issues that arise with the electrical systems. This requires conducting system testing to verify performance and compliance with site specifications. You'll use diagnostic equipment like multimeters to pinpoint and resolve any electrical problems efficiently.

### Supervise and Mentor Apprentices

As a Journeyman Electrician, you will also oversee apprentices, ensuring they adhere to safety protocols and best practices. Your mentorship will be crucial in teaching them the intricacies of EV-specific electrical systems and fostering their development in the field.

### Collaborate with Project Teams

You'll work closely with project managers and other trades to meet construction schedules and deliver quality installations. This collaboration is essential to ensure the seamless integration of electrical systems within the overall project framework.

### Additional Common Tasks

Other common daily activities include maintaining accurate documentation of installations and site activities, submitting daily reports as required, and conducting load calculations for EV charging infrastructure.

## What You Need to Be a Journeyman Electrician

To excel in this role, you must have an active and valid journeyman electrician certification from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). You should possess a strong knowledge of NEC and California Electric Code, with specific experience in EV charging station installations. Practical skills with conduit bending tools, multimeters, and the ability to read and interpret blueprints, schematics, and electrical diagrams are essential.

### Must-Have Skills

- 3-5 years of experience as a Journeyman Electrician
- Demonstrated leadership skills in supervising apprentices and managing on-site safety
- Excellent communication and organizational skills to ensure project success
