## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

At Berks Electrical, we are looking for motivated Apprentice Electricians to join our dynamic team for a multi-year project in Sierra Vista, AZ, with additional opportunities in nearby cities such as Hereford, Huachuca City, and Tombstone. As an Apprentice Electrician, you'll be a crucial part of our operations, working alongside experienced professionals to bring innovative electrical solutions to life. Your role will be hands-on and integral to the success of our projects, primarily focusing on the installation and maintenance of electrical systems in both residential and commercial settings.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

Your daily work will involve a variety of tasks essential to the seamless installation and upkeep of our electrical projects. You'll support the installation of solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations, ensuring each component is securely and efficiently connected. Your responsibilities will also include running conduit, pulling wire, and assisting in connecting inverters to electrical panels, all under the guidance of our senior technicians.

You'll learn to interpret system blueprints and layouts, gaining the knowledge needed to contribute meaningfully to renewable energy projects. Routine inspections and maintenance will be part of your daily duties, ensuring all systems operate at optimal performance. You'll also monitor and troubleshoot system components, learning to address issues that arise in real-time. Maintaining a clean and organized work environment is critical, as it facilitates efficiency and safety on-site. Other common activities include assisting with the setup and breakdown of work areas and participating in team meetings to discuss project progress and safety protocols.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To thrive in this role, you'll need a solid understanding of basic electrical concepts and a keen interest in renewable energy systems. An eagerness to learn about solar, battery, and EV charging technology is essential. The ability to work outdoors in varying weather conditions and safely at heights, like on rooftops, is crucial. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail will help you succeed, along with a willingness to travel between job sites and work extended hours when necessary.

Preferred candidates will have 1-4 years of experience in the field as an Apprentice Electrician. Must-have skills include proficiency in using hand and power tools, an understanding of safety protocols, and the ability to communicate effectively with team members. While a high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, technical coursework in renewable energy is an added advantage.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $21.13-$25.04 per hour, depending on your experience and expertise. As part of our team, you'll benefit from numerous opportunities for career advancement and professional growth. We are committed to providing ongoing training and certifications to help you expand your skill set and advance in your career. Additional benefits include health insurance options, paid time off, and a supportive work environment that encourages continuous learning and development.
