As a Fire Alarm Installer at Granite State Electric, you'll play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and security of our clients' properties in Winter Park, FL, and its neighboring cities, including Orlando, Altamonte Springs, and Maitland. Your job is hands-on and vital, covering everything from installation to maintenance of fire alarm systems. We're engaged in a multi-year project that demands precision, dedication, and a keen eye for safety standards. You'll be an integral part of a team that values expertise and a no-nonsense approach to fire safety.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Fire Alarm Installer

Your day-to-day activities will involve installing, testing, and maintaining state-of-the-art fire alarm systems across various commercial and industrial sites. You'll work with control panels, pull stations, and notification devices, ensuring they meet both local and NFPA standards. Conducting thorough inspections will be second nature as you verify that every component is up to code. When issues arise, you'll troubleshoot and repair faulty wiring or devices to maintain system reliability. You'll also coordinate with contractors and building managers to ensure installations are timely and efficient, whether in new builds or existing structures. Programming fire alarm systems to integrate seamlessly with other safety equipment, such as sprinklers and emergency lighting, is a key part of your role. Additionally, maintaining detailed service logs and providing documentation for system approvals and inspections is essential to your success.

Common daily activities include:
- Conducting site assessments to determine the best installation strategies
- Running and securing electrical wiring for alarm systems
- Performing regular system tests to ensure operational readiness

To excel in this role, you should bring 3-5 years of experience in installing and maintaining fire alarm systems in commercial settings. A solid understanding of NFPA codes and Florida fire safety regulations is crucial. You'll need proficiency with tools and software used for fire alarm programming and diagnostics. The ability to work at heights and in confined spaces is necessary given the nature of our job sites. Strong organizational skills will help you manage multiple projects and meet deadlines efficiently. Effective communication skills are also vital for collaborating with team members and clients.

Must-have skills include:
- Hands-on experience with electrical systems and fire safety equipment
- Competency in using diagnostic tools and software
- The ability to interpret technical drawings and blueprints
