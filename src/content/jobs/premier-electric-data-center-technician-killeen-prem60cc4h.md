## Join Our Team as a Data Center Technician at Premier Electric!

Hey there! If you're a seasoned pro with 3-5 years under your belt installing, terminating, and testing Cat6/6A and fiber cables, we want to chat with you. At Premier Electric in Killeen, TX, we're on the lookout for a Data Center Technician who knows their way around Fluke testers, cable combs, and termination tools like nobody's business.

### Why This Role Rocks:

You'll be diving into a world where your work directly impacts the efficiency and reliability of our data centers. Imagine working alongside a talented team, installing and terminating cables, and using your skills to mount patch panels and servers. Your attention to detail will shine as you dress cables in racks with Velcro ties, ensuring everything is neat and tidy. Plus, you’ll get to test cable integrity using Fluke testers and document your installations and results.

Your day will be dynamic—one moment you’re installing cable trays and ladder racks, the next you’re reading network diagrams and making sure everything meets clean room standards. You'll be based in Killeen but might find yourself exploring neighboring cities as part of your role.

### What's in It for You?

We're offering competitive pay ranging from $26.99 to $32.95 per hour, along with fantastic benefits and perks. We provide all the tools and equipment you'll need, and we’re committed to your growth with ongoing training opportunities.

Ready to make an impact and grow your career with Premier Electric? Join us and be part of a team that values your skills and is dedicated to your long-term success. Apply today and let's shape the future of data centers together!
