## What You'll Do as a Motor Mechanic

Welcome to Burdett Hill's construction team for our multi-year project in Virginia Beach, VA, with potential assignments in nearby cities such as Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth. As a Motor Mechanic, you'll play a crucial role in ensuring our machinery operates smoothly. This position involves hands-on work with motors, pumps, and generators of up to 12,000 HP, emphasizing reliability and performance. Expect to dive deep into the mechanics, diagnosing and solving issues to keep our projects running efficiently.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Motor Mechanic

Your day will start by reviewing assignments and assessing the condition of equipment that needs attention. You'll disassemble motors, pumps, and generators, meticulously inspecting each component for signs of wear or failure. Troubleshooting is key; you'll diagnose issues like oil leaks, vibrations, or electrical malfunctions, determining the best repair approach. After repairs, you'll reassemble the machinery and conduct test runs to ensure everything is functioning perfectly.

You'll frequently collaborate with machinists to ensure parts meet exact specifications, and work closely with quality control technicians to uphold our high standards. Maintaining accurate records of your work is crucial, documenting every repair and test result. On a typical day, you might also perform routine maintenance checks and respond to emergency repair requests, always ready to apply your expertise to keep operations seamless.

## What You Need to Be a Motor Mechanic

To excel in this role, you must have at least 5 years of experience in disassembling and repairing motors and generators. A high school diploma or equivalent is required, alongside the ability to read and interpret technical drawings with precision. You'll need to bring your own set of tools and possess excellent communication skills to collaborate effectively with team members.

Physical stamina is essential, as you'll need to lift up to 50 pounds and be prepared to work extended hours, including weekends and holidays. Your hands-on abilities are crucial, with a keen eye for detail and a proactive approach to problem-solving. If you have a knack for diagnosing mechanical issues and a passion for keeping machinery in top shape, you'll fit right in.

## Compensation
