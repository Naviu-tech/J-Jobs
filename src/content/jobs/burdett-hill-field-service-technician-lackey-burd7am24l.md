## What You'll Do as a Field Service Technician

Welcome to Burdett Hill, where we're embarking on a multi-year project in Lackey, VA, with additional opportunities in nearby cities like Yorktown, Williamsburg, and Newport News. As a Field Service Technician, you'll be the backbone of our operations, ensuring that our industrial equipment is running smoothly and efficiently. This role is all about hands-on work, troubleshooting, and keeping everything up and running. If you're someone who enjoys solving mechanical puzzles and working directly with equipment, this is the position for you.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Field Service Technician

Your day-to-day will be filled with a variety of tasks that keep things interesting and challenging. You'll be responsible for installing, troubleshooting, and repairing industrial equipment, including motors, pumps, and gearboxes. Using your expertise, you'll employ rigging and alignment tools to ensure precise equipment installation. Diagnostics will be a key component of your role, using vibration analysis and visual inspections to identify potential issues before they become major problems.

In addition to these technical tasks, you'll collaborate closely with our clients to identify and resolve mechanical issues, ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. You'll also maintain detailed reports of your work, guaranteeing compliance with safety standards, and contribute to a safe working environment. Other common activities include conducting regular maintenance checks and responding promptly to any equipment failures or emergencies.

## What You Need to Be a Field Service Technician

To succeed in this role, you should have at least a high school diploma or equivalent, along with a minimum of 2 years of experience in mechanical environments. A valid driver’s license is essential, as you'll be traveling to different project sites in Lackey and its neighboring areas. You'll need a solid understanding of industrial safety and rigging practices, as well as hands-on experience with equipment diagnostics and repair.

Training in vibration analysis and laser alignment is preferred, but if you're eager to learn, we're here to support you. Must-have skills include problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to work independently as well as part of a team. Your hands-on abilities will be your greatest asset, as you'll be directly interfacing with complex machinery daily.
