## What You'll Do as a Quality Control Technician

As a Quality Control Technician at Burdett Hill, your role is crucial to maintaining the integrity and safety of our projects in Grandy, NC, and nearby areas such as Camden, Jarvisburg, and Poplar Branch. We're working on a multi-year project that requires meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to excellence. You'll be ensuring that every piece of equipment we work on meets our high standards, contributing to the success and reputation of our company. Your expertise in quality control will be essential to the seamless operation of our construction and manufacturing processes.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Quality Control Technician

Your day will begin with performing dimensional and visual inspections of disassembled electric motors and their parts to determine what repairs are necessary. You'll verify new and repaired parts against engineering drawings and specifications, ensuring they fit perfectly within our operational standards. Conducting in-process surveillance will be a key part of your role, as well as performing final inspections to release motors for shipment. You'll ensure that all paperwork and documentation are completed accurately and legibly, which is crucial for maintaining our records and meeting compliance standards. Additionally, collaborating closely with machinists and repair technicians to ensure quality standards are met will be part of your daily routine. You might also calibrate and maintain inspection equipment, ensuring that all tools are in top working condition to support precise measurements.

To excel in this role, you'll need a high school diploma or equivalent, along with at least 3 years of experience using precision measurement tools, such as micrometers, calipers, and dial indicators. You should be capable of safely lifting 50 pounds and be comfortable working in physically demanding environments, as our projects can require significant manual effort. Flexibility is key; you should be ready to work overtime, weekends, and holidays as needed. A background as a military mechanical technician is preferred, as it indicates the discipline and skill set we value highly. Must-have skills include a keen eye for detail, strong problem-solving capabilities, and the ability to work collaboratively with a diverse team.
