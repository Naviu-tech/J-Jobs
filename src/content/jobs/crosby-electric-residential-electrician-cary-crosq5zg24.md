## The Work Environment

At Crosby Electric, Residential Electrician Apprentices can expect to work on a variety of jobsites throughout Cary, NC. These environments range from newly constructed homes to older residences undergoing renovations. The work is primarily conducted indoors, but tasks may occasionally require outdoor activity depending on project needs.

The role requires adaptability, as work conditions can vary with weather and project demands. Safety is a top priority, and all team members must adhere to strict safety protocols to ensure a secure work environment.

## Essential Trade Skills

As a Residential Electrician Apprentice, possessing a high school diploma or equivalent is essential. Enrollment in an apprenticeship program is preferred, as it provides structured learning and growth. A basic understanding of electrical concepts is necessary, but the willingness to learn on the job is equally important. Effective communication and teamwork skills are critical, as apprentices will work closely with licensed electricians and other crew members. Physical fitness is required to handle tools and materials, and a keen attention to detail and safety awareness is crucial. Reliable transportation and punctuality are necessary to meet jobsite demands, and a strong interest in residential electrical systems will drive success in this role.

## Daily Operations

Tasks include installing outlets, switches, lighting fixtures, and circuit breakers while maintaining a clean and organized workspace. Apprentices will perform basic troubleshooting under the guidance of licensed electricians and document their daily tasks and learning progress. Attendance at required apprenticeship classes and training sessions is mandatory, and apprentices must follow safety guidelines and participate in site inspections and testing procedures. Coordination with team members and supervisors ensures project tasks are completed efficiently.

## Requirements & Experience

The position is open to individuals with 0-3 years of field experience. The role demands physical stamina to lift and move tools and materials, and adherence to safety requirements is non-negotiable to maintain a safe work environment.
