## Core Low Voltage Cable Technician Responsibilities

Your role will encompass several key responsibilities, including the installation, termination, and testing of low voltage cabling systems for voice, data, and video networks. You will be instrumental in setting up and configuring structured cabling systems, including fiber optics and Ethernet cables. You will also develop the ability to read and interpret blueprints, technical drawings, and network schematics.

Routine maintenance and troubleshooting of cabling systems will be part of your duties, performed under the supervision of our senior technicians. Adherence to safety guidelines and compliance with local building codes are paramount, ensuring both personal safety and project integrity. You will maintain well-organized work areas and manage the inventory of tools and materials on site. Collaboration with team members will be crucial to ensuring timely project completion and quality assurance.

Advanced technical duties will include:
- Implementing advanced testing procedures using specialized equipment to ensure cabling integrity.
- Assisting in the design and layout of network systems for large-scale projects.
- Leading small project teams in the absence of senior technicians.

Regional projects will often involve installations in both urban settings and suburban developments, requiring adaptability and meticulous planning. Our technicians adhere to stringent safety protocols, wearing proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and following OSHA guidelines to mitigate risks.
