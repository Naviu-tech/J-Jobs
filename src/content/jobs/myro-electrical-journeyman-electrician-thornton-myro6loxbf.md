## The Journeyman Electrician Position

Joining our team as a Journeyman Electrician means stepping into a role that is both challenging and rewarding. You will be responsible for the day-to-day execution of electrical installations, ensuring that all systems are functional and reliable. Our projects span commercial buildings, residential complexes, and industrial sites, providing a dynamic work environment.

This structure ensures clear communication and efficient project completion. At Myro Electrical, we offer ample growth opportunities, encouraging our electricians to advance their skills and progress to senior roles within the company.

## Core Journeyman Electrician Responsibilities

As a Journeyman Electrician, your main duties will include installing and maintaining commercial electrical systems such as switchgear, transformers, lighting fixtures, and power circuits. You'll need to accurately measure, cut, and bend conduit (EMT, rigid) for system installations and perform wire pulling, labeling, and termination, ensuring neat and secure connections. Troubleshooting electrical issues using multimeters and other diagnostic tools to ensure compliance with NEC code requirements is crucial. You will work collaboratively with other trades to plan and execute electrical installations within construction schedules, supervise apprentices, and provide guidance on proper techniques and safety practices. Maintaining organized and clean job sites while adhering to all safety and operational standards is paramount. Additionally, you will engage in advanced technical duties such as programming and commissioning energy management systems, performing infrared thermography for predictive maintenance, and integrating renewable energy solutions into existing infrastructures. Given the regional focus, familiarity with local building codes and climate considerations in our project areas is vital. Safety protocols include mandatory PPE, regular safety drills, and adherence to OSHA standards.

## Required Experience & Skills

Candidates must possess a valid journeyman electrician license, showing a deep understanding of NEC codes. Proficiency with conduit bending, electrical tools, and strong troubleshooting skills are essential. Leadership abilities are necessary to effectively manage apprentices and teams. A minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a Journeyman Electrician is required. Essential certifications include OSHA 30, CPR/First Aid, and specialized training in high-voltage systems. Technical knowledge should cover advanced circuit analysis, control systems, and energy-efficient installations.

## Tools & Equipment

Our Journeyman Electricians use a variety of tools daily, including multimeters, conduit benders, and power drills. Personal tools you must bring include a set of screwdrivers, pliers, and wire strippers. Myro Electrical provides company equipment such as ladders, testing devices, and safety gear, ensuring you have everything needed to perform your job efficiently.

## Physical Requirements

The role requires the ability to lift at least 50 pounds regularly and perform tasks that involve standing, walking, and working in confined spaces. Working conditions vary from indoor projects to outdoor sites exposed to weather elements. Safety gear, including hard hats, gloves, and protective eyewear, is mandatory at all times.
