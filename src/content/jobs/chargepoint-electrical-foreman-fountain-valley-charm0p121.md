## What You'll Do as an Electrical Foreman

As an Electrical Foreman at ChargePoint, you'll play a crucial role in our multi-year project in Fountain Valley, CA, with additional opportunities in nearby cities like Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa, and Santa Ana. Your primary responsibility will be to oversee the installation and maintenance of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. This position requires a hands-on approach and thorough knowledge of commercial electrical systems. You'll ensure that all work adheres to project designs, safety standards, and deadlines, maintaining a high standard of quality and efficiency.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrical Foreman

In your role, you'll lead field operations, focusing on the installation of service panels, transformers, conduits (EMT, rigid), and EV charging equipment. Your day-to-day tasks will include planning and assigning daily activities for journeymen and apprentices to ensure efficient crew operations. You'll be responsible for maintaining safety protocols and conducting conduit bending, wire pulling, labeling, and terminations in line with NEC and California Electric Code standards. Troubleshooting electrical issues will be a regular part of your job, requiring you to use diagnostic tools such as multimeters and megohmmeters. 

You'll also provide on-site leadership, coaching, and mentoring to your team while maintaining a clean and organized job site. Collaborating with project managers, clients, and other trades to tackle field challenges and ensure seamless project execution will be essential. Your role will include maintaining daily reports documenting project progress, labor hours, material usage, and any deviations from plans. Regular safety meetings will be conducted to enforce compliance and ensure the well-being of your team.

## What You Need to Be an Electrical Foreman

To succeed in this role, you must have an active and valid journeyman electrician certification from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). A minimum of 5 years of experience in commercial electrical work, with at least 2 years in a leadership role, is essential. You should possess extensive knowledge of NEC and California Electric Code, with hands-on experience in EV charging station installations. Proficiency in conduit bending, wire termination, and troubleshooting electrical systems is required, along with strong leadership and communication skills. A valid driver's license with a clean driving record is necessary, as well as the ability to maintain auto insurance coverage. OSHA 30-hour certification and First Aid/CPR are preferred, and familiarity with construction management software like Site Tracker is a plus.
