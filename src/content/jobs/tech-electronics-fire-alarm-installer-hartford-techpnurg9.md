Join us at Tech Electronics in Hartford, CT, where we're all about keeping people safe and sound. We serve not just Hartford, but also our neighbors in West Hartford, East Hartford, and New Britain. We’re on the lookout for someone like you to become our next Fire Alarm Installer. If you're passionate about working with advanced fire alarm systems and love the idea of making a real impact, then this might just be the perfect fit for you!

## Qualifications

We're looking for someone who can hit the ground running with a solid understanding of fire alarm systems, initiating devices, and notification appliances. Experience with Notifier, Simplex, or Edwards systems is a big plus. While NICET Level I is preferred, it's not a deal-breaker if you don't have it yet. However, OSHA-10 and First Aid/CPR certifications are a must. You should know your way around NFPA 72, be able to read blueprints, and have a grasp of basic electricity. A clean driving record and the ability to pass a background check are essential. Plus, you should be prepared to join the on-call rotation after your training period. We're looking for someone with 1-3 years of experience in fire alarm work, especially in a commercial setting.

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you'll be installing fire alarm devices, pulling wire, and jumping in to assist with system testing. Keeping documentation up to date and helping with troubleshooting are also part of the gig. You'll be the go-to person for ensuring our systems are top-notch.

## Compensation & Benefits

- Salary Range: $23.84-$31.92 per hour
- You'll enjoy a comprehensive benefits package that takes care of you as much as you take care of our clients.
- We offer plenty of opportunities for career advancement, so you can grow with us.
- Ongoing training and certifications will keep you sharp and ready for anything. 

Come join us and be a part of something vital—helping protect lives and property with top-of-the-line fire alarm systems. We can't wait to meet you!
