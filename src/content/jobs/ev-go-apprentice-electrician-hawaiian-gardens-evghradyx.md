## About Our Apprentice Electrician Team

At EV GO, our team of Apprentice Electricians plays a pivotal role in revolutionizing the electric vehicle infrastructure in Hawaiian Gardens and its neighboring areas, including Cypress, Cerritos, and Lakewood. With a reputation for excellence, EV GO stands at the forefront of the transition to sustainable transportation by installing and maintaining cutting-edge EV charging stations. Our Apprentice Electricians are integral to this mission, working on diverse projects ranging from small residential installations to large commercial endeavors. We pride ourselves on fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment where every team member can thrive and contribute to the energy future of Southern California.

## The Apprentice Electrician Position

Joining EV GO as an Apprentice Electrician means embarking on a journey of professional growth and skill development. In this role, you will support the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations across a variety of settings, including urban centers, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial zones. Your day-to-day responsibilities will involve working closely with journeymen and foremen, ensuring that each project is executed with precision and adherence to safety standards. Our team structure is designed to provide mentorship and guidance, allowing you to learn from seasoned professionals. There is significant growth potential within EV GO, as we are committed to promoting from within and providing pathways to advance to journeyman and master electrician roles.

## Core Apprentice Electrician Responsibilities

As an Apprentice Electrician at EV GO, your primary duties will include assisting experienced electricians in the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations, ensuring compliance with NEC and California Electric Code standards. Your responsibilities will include pulling and securing electrical wiring through conduits, trenches, and walls, and assisting in conduit bending and installation. You will help install service panels, transformers, and charging equipment, and perform basic troubleshooting tasks under supervision. Maintaining cleanliness and organization on site, attending daily safety meetings, and adhering to safety protocols are essential aspects of your role. You will also document daily work progress and report any operational issues. Advanced duties include participating in complex wiring layouts, assisting in the calibration of charging equipment, and supporting advanced diagnostic tasks. Safety is paramount; you will follow rigorous protocols to ensure a safe working environment for all team members.

## Required Experience & Skills

To qualify for the Apprentice Electrician position at EV GO, you must hold a valid Electrical Trainee card from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). A basic understanding of electrical systems, tools, and equipment is essential, and familiarity with NEC and California Electric Code is advantageous. We seek individuals with a strong willingness to learn and develop their skills under the guidance of experienced electricians. Reliable transportation to job sites in Hawaiian Gardens and surrounding cities is necessary, as is the ability to work across multiple locations. Preferred qualifications include an OSHA 10-hour certification and First Aid/CPR certification. The role requires physical stamina to perform manual labor, including lifting up to 50 pounds and working on ladders or in confined spaces.

## Tools & Equipment

Our Apprentice Electricians utilize a variety of tools daily, including wire strippers, multimeters, conduit benders, and power drills. While EV GO provides necessary equipment like safety helmets, gloves, and protective eyewear, apprentices are expected to have personal tools such as screwdrivers, pliers, and tape measures. The company ensures that you have access to the best tools and resources to perform your duties efficiently and safely.

## Physical Requirements

The Apprentice Electrician role requires the ability to lift and carry up to 50 pounds regularly.
