## What You'll Do as an Electrician

As an Electrician at Tech Electronics in Columbus, GA, you will play an integral role in our construction projects, bringing power and connectivity to life. You'll be working on a variety of commercial installations, ensuring that electrical systems are safely and efficiently set up to meet the needs of our clients. Our projects range from new builds to renovations, and your expertise will be vital in maintaining the high standards we hold. Day-to-day, you’ll be at the heart of our operations, making sure that everything from initial setup to final testing runs smoothly.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician

Your day will start with reviewing blueprints and planning your tasks, ensuring you have a clear understanding of the project requirements. You'll be responsible for installing commercial electrical systems, including the accurate setup of switchgear, panels, and transformers. This involves measuring, cutting, bending, and installing both EMT and rigid conduits with precision.

Engaging in wire pulling and termination within conduits and boxes is a significant part of your role, where you'll ensure all connections are secure and neatly organized. You'll also install and wire lighting fixtures, outlets, and power circuits, ensuring they meet client specifications and safety standards.

Testing and troubleshooting circuits and electrical components will be a regular part of your work, using tools like multimeters to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Collaboration is key, and you'll work closely with other trades to ensure installations are completed on time and within the project's scope. Maintaining a clean and safe work environment is paramount, and you'll ensure all areas comply with safety standards.

Additional daily activities may include conducting site inspections to anticipate potential issues and assisting in the training of apprentices, sharing your expertise to build a stronger team.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician

To excel in this role, proficiency with conduit benders and power tools is essential. A thorough understanding of NEC codes is required to ensure compliance and safety. You'll often work on lifts and scaffolding, so comfort with heights and a strong focus on safety are crucial. Strong troubleshooting skills are necessary to efficiently diagnose and resolve issues that arise on the job.

Experience with lighting control systems will be beneficial, and having leadership capabilities to mentor apprentices can set you apart. A minimum of 3-5 years of experience in the field is required to ensure you have the hands-on skills needed for our projects.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $32.72-$40.57 per hour, depending on your experience. At Tech Electronics, we believe in investing in our employees' growth, providing career advancement opportunities, and access to ongoing training and certifications. Our benefits package is designed with you in mind, offering comprehensive support and incentives to enhance your career as an Electrician.
