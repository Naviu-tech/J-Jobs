## The PLC Technician Position

As a PLC Technician with EZ Electric, you'll find yourself at the heart of our operations, undertaking a variety of critical tasks central to our success. Your day-to-day responsibilities will involve designing, programming, testing, and maintaining PLC systems, ensuring they meet the high standards our clients expect. You'll work across a range of environments, from manufacturing plants to commercial buildings, adapting to the unique challenges each project presents. You'll be part of a cohesive team structure, collaborating closely with engineers, project managers, and other technicians, while also enjoying the autonomy to lead aspects of projects under minimal supervision. At EZ Electric, the growth potential is substantial, with opportunities to advance into senior technical roles or project management positions as you develop your skills and experience.

## Core PLC Technician Responsibilities

A key responsibility will be leading the commissioning and startup of PLC and DDC control systems, ensuring seamless integration and reliable performance that meets project specifications. You'll collaborate with engineers, clients, and electrical teams to solve complex automation challenges, delivering high-quality outcomes that exceed client expectations. Maintaining detailed records of system modifications and operations is crucial, ensuring all project documentation aligns with current statuses. As a technical leader on-site, you'll guide subcontractors, enforce quality control standards, and resolve issues efficiently, ensuring all safety protocols are rigorously followed. You will also be expected to perform advanced technical duties such as developing custom control logic, optimizing networked automation systems, and conducting advanced diagnostics on malfunctioning equipment. Regional projects will occasionally require travel to client sites, with up to 30% of your time dedicated to overseeing project implementation and ensuring operational success.

Safety gear required includes hard hats, steel-toe boots, and high-visibility clothing, ensuring your safety on-site is always prioritized.
