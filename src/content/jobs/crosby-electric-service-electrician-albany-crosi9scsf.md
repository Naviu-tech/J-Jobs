Hey there! We're Crosby Electric, and we're excited to welcome a Senior Service Electrician to our team in Albany, NY. Our city, nestled near Troy, Schenectady, and Saratoga Springs, offers a vibrant mix of urban and suburban living, perfect for both work and play. We're looking for someone who is as passionate about electrical systems as we are and ready to tackle the challenges of critical facilities and power quality. If you're someone who thrives in a dynamic environment and loves solving complex problems, we’d love to chat with you!

## Key Responsibilities
You'll get to dive deep into advanced electrical system diagnostics using tools like power quality analyzers, thermal imaging, and oscilloscopes. Troubleshooting building automation system integration issues and designing power factor correction solutions will be part of your day-to-day. Expect to manage emergency power system testing, develop maintenance programs for critical facilities, and train facility staff. You'll also coordinate with local utilities on service upgrades, key for keeping Albany's infrastructure humming. Regional requirements for NY will also have you performing arc flash assessments and labeling. Plus, you'll be documenting your findings and recommendations, ensuring our clients are always in the loop.

## Required Qualifications
We're looking for someone with a Journeyman License—though a master electrician would be a huge plus. Advanced certifications in power quality analysis are essential, and you should have extensive experience with thermal imaging and diagnostic equipment. You'll need at least 7+ years of experience in a commercial setting, demonstrating expertise in critical power systems and advanced troubleshooting skills across various systems. Being familiar with Albany’s specific building codes and regulations is a must, and having a knack for customer relationship management will help you shine in this role.

## Compensation & Benefits
We offer a competitive salary ranging from $37.73 to $42.82 per hour, based on your experience. You'll enjoy comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays to keep you refreshed and recharged. We're big on career advancement, so there are plenty of opportunities to grow with us. Plus, we provide ongoing training and certifications to keep your skills sharp and up-to-date.

If this sounds like the perfect fit for you, let's get the conversation started! We can't wait to see how you'll make a difference with Crosby Electric.
