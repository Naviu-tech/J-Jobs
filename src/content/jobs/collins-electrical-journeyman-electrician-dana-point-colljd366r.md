## About Our Journeyman Electrician Team

Joining the team at Collins Electrical as a Journeyman Electrician means becoming part of a legacy of excellence in electrical contracting. With a strong reputation in Dana Point and the surrounding areas, including Laguna Beach, San Clemente, and Mission Viejo, our team is known for handling a diverse range of projects, from commercial installations to complex residential systems. Our Journeyman Electricians are at the forefront of innovative electrical solutions, particularly in the burgeoning field of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. We pride ourselves on our commitment to quality, safety, and professional growth, making Collins Electrical a sought-after employer in the region.

## The Journeyman Electrician Position

As a Journeyman Electrician at Collins Electrical, you will be entrusted with a dynamic array of responsibilities. Your day-to-day tasks will involve the installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of electrical systems, with a special focus on EV charging stations. These projects span various environments, from commercial parking structures to residential properties, providing you with a broad spectrum of challenges and learning opportunities.

You'll work within a well-structured team, often under the guidance of a Master Electrician and alongside project managers and other tradespeople. This collaborative environment fosters growth, allowing you to expand your technical skills and take on leadership roles. At Collins Electrical, there is ample potential for career advancement, with pathways that can lead to senior supervisory positions or specialized roles within the company.

## Core Journeyman Electrician Responsibilities

Your primary responsibilities will include the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations, involving service panels, transformers, and associated components. You'll expertly measure, cut, and bend various types of conduit, such as EMT and rigid, ensuring precise alignment and installation. Pulling, labeling, and terminating wiring with meticulous attention to organization and compliance with NEC and California Electric Code standards is crucial.

Advanced technical duties will include performing load calculations and installing main service equipment for EV infrastructure, conducting rigorous system testing for performance, safety, and compliance, and collaborating effectively with project managers and interdisciplinary teams to ensure project milestones are met. Supervising apprentices will also be a key role, nurturing their development in EV-specific systems, and maintaining stringent adherence to safety protocols.

In the Dana Point area, projects may include high-profile commercial developments and eco-friendly residential communities, all requiring precision and adherence to local codes and regulations. Safety is paramount, and you will be expected to lead by example, ensuring all site activities are documented accurately and reported daily.

## Required Experience & Skills

To be successful in this role, you must possess an active and valid journeyman electrician certification from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). A robust understanding of the NEC and California Electric Code is essential, with specific expertise in EV charging station installations. Proficiency with conduit bending tools, multimeters, and other diagnostic equipment is crucial, as is the ability to read and interpret complex blueprints, schematics, and electrical diagrams.

Leadership skills are vital, particularly in supervising apprentices and managing on-site safety. Strong communication and organizational skills will ensure the success of both individual projects and team objectives. A minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a Journeyman Electrician is required, along with certifications such as OSHA 30 or CPR/First Aid.

## Tools & Equipment

Journeyman Electricians at Collins Electrical utilize a variety of tools daily, including conduit benders, wire strippers, multimeters, and power drills. Personal tools that you will need to provide include a set of insulated hand tools, a voltage tester, and a reliable pair of pliers. The company provides specialized equipment, such as transformer testers and conduit threading machines, ensuring that you have access to everything necessary for quality installations.

## Physical Requirements

The role requires the ability to lift up to 50 pounds regularly and work in various conditions, including confined spaces and at heights. You will be expected to work outdoors in different weather conditions, requiring resilience and adaptability. Safety gear, including hard hats, safety glasses, gloves, and steel-toed boots, is mandatory and provided by the company.

## Training & Development

Collins Electrical is committed to the professional development of its team members. Our mentorship program pairs you with experienced electricians who provide guidance and support. We also offer certifications in specialized areas such as advanced conduit bending techniques and EV charging station technology.
