## What You'll Do as a General Foreman

The role of a General Foreman at ChargePoint is pivotal in steering the success of our multi-year projects in Carson, CA, and surrounding areas like Torrance, Long Beach, and Compton. As a General Foreman, your expertise will be essential in managing the civil components of our medium to large-scale electrical projects, with a particular focus on electric vehicle (EV) charging station installations. Your leadership will ensure that our projects are not only completed on time and within budget but also adhere to the highest standards of quality and safety.

## Your Daily Tasks as a General Foreman

As a General Foreman, your day will start with overseeing and managing the civil scope of work, ensuring that each project phase is executed flawlessly. You will supervise multiple crews involved in activities such as excavation, backfill, rebar installation, concrete pouring, bollard installation, and asphalt work. Each day, you will review and interpret project plans and blueprints, ensuring compliance with design specifications and California Building Code standards.

A crucial part of your role will be coordinating with project managers, subcontractors, and other teams to ensure smooth project execution. You'll conduct milestone inspections, verify adherence to safety standards, and implement corrective actions whenever necessary. Your keen eye for detail will help maintain daily reports that detail labor hours, resource usage, and project status.

In addition to these tasks, you will monitor and enforce compliance with Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans (SWIPPs), ensuring environmental conditions like stormwater management and site cleanliness are upheld. Conducting regular toolbox talks and safety meetings will be essential to uphold a safety-first culture. You will also ensure that all crew certifications and equipment are current and compliant with governing standards.

Common daily activities include troubleshooting on-site issues, adjusting work schedules to accommodate weather changes, and mentoring crew members to enhance their skills and productivity. Collaborating with project leadership to address scope changes, track additional work, and maintain accurate documentation for contract variations will also be part of your daily responsibilities.

## What You Need to Be a General Foreman

To excel as a General Foreman, you will need a minimum of 8-10 years of experience as a lead project foreman in commercial civil construction. A strong knowledge of the California Building Code and OSHA safety standards is crucial. Your proven track record in leading teams for excavation, concrete, rebar, asphalt, and similar civil tasks will set you apart.

Key skills include strong leadership, organizational, and problem-solving abilities. Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite and familiarity with construction project management software, such as Site Tracker, is important. A valid driver's license with a clean record and the ability to maintain coverage on company auto insurance is required. While not mandatory, having OSHA 30-hour and First Aid/CPR certifications is preferred.

## Compensation

At ChargePoint, we offer a competitive salary range of $67.44-$81.56 per hour, depending on your experience. We believe in fostering career advancement opportunities and provide ongoing training and certifications to support your professional growth. Our comprehensive benefits package is designed to support you both on and off the job, ensuring you have the tools and resources you need to succeed as a General Foreman.
