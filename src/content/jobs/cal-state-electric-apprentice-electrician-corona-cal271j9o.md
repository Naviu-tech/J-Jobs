As an Apprentice Electrician at Cal State Electric, you'll be an essential part of our team working on a multi-year project in Corona, CA, with additional opportunities in nearby cities such as Riverside, Norco, and Chino. Your role will be hands-on and dynamic, involving a diverse range of tasks as you support our mission to deliver top-notch electrical solutions in renewable energy installations. You'll gain invaluable experience while working alongside experienced electricians, learning the ropes of solar panel, battery storage, and EV charging station installations.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

Your day-to-day activities will include supporting the installation of solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations at both residential and commercial sites. You'll assist in running conduit, pulling wire, and connecting inverters to electrical panels. A significant part of your work will involve learning to interpret system blueprints and layouts, ensuring that renewable energy projects are installed correctly and efficiently. 

You'll also perform routine inspections and maintenance on installed systems, ensuring they operate at peak performance. Monitoring and troubleshooting system components under the guidance of senior technicians will be part of your daily tasks. Additionally, you'll ensure compliance with local building codes and renewable energy guidelines to guarantee safety and quality. Maintaining a clean and organized work environment, including managing tools and materials on-site, is crucial. Other common daily activities include assisting with electrical load calculations and participating in team meetings to discuss project progress and safety protocols.

Problem-solving skills and attention to detail are crucial in this role, as is the willingness to travel between job sites and work extended hours when necessary.

Ideally, you'll have 1-4 years of experience in the field as an Apprentice Electrician. Must-have skills include proficiency in using hand and power tools, basic electrical troubleshooting abilities, and a solid grasp of safety protocols. A high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, and technical coursework in renewable energy is a plus. Hands-on abilities, such as the capacity to lift heavy equipment and work in confined spaces, will be essential to your success.
