## What You'll Do as a PLC Technician

As a PLC Technician at Crosby Electric, you will play a critical role in our multi-year project based in Falls Church, VA, with additional projects in nearby areas like Arlington, Alexandria, and Fairfax. Your primary responsibility will be to ensure the successful integration and operation of PLC and DDC control systems. This is not just a desk job—it's hands-on work that directly impacts the success of our projects. You will be a vital link in the chain, ensuring that our systems run smoothly and efficiently.

## Your Daily Tasks as a PLC Technician

### Lead Commissioning and Startup

Your day will typically start with leading the commissioning and startup of PLC and DDC control systems. You'll work closely with engineers and construction teams, ensuring that the systems are integrated seamlessly into the project framework. Your technical expertise will be crucial in solving any automation challenges that arise, making sure the systems deliver high-quality performance.

### Collaborate and Solve

Another key part of your role will involve collaborating with engineers, clients, and electrical teams. You'll be the go-to expert for solving automation challenges, providing innovative solutions, and ensuring that all systems meet the project's standards and expectations. Whether it's troubleshooting a system glitch or suggesting improvements, your input will be invaluable.

### Maintain and Document

Maintaining detailed records of system modifications and operations is an essential part of your job. You'll ensure that all project documentation is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current status of the systems. This involves not just keeping records but also communicating effectively with the team to ensure everyone is on the same page.

### Provide On-Site Leadership

You'll provide technical leadership on-site, guiding subcontractors and enforcing quality control standards. Your ability to resolve issues efficiently will keep the project on track and ensure that all systems are functioning optimally. This may also involve traveling to client sites, up to 30% of the time, to oversee project implementation and operational success.

### Practical Work Examples

In addition to these primary tasks, you'll frequently calibrate sensors, update software algorithms, and troubleshoot hardware failures. These practical activities require precision and a keen attention to detail, ensuring that all components work harmoniously within the larger system.

## What You Need to Be a PLC Technician

### Experience and Skills

To excel in this role, you need at least 2 years of experience as a PLC Technician, preferably with platforms like Siemens TIA Portal, Allen Bradley Studio 5000, or similar systems such as Inductive Automation Ignition or ICONICS. Proficiency in PLC installation, commissioning, and troubleshooting is a must. You should possess a strong understanding of HVAC control theory, electronics, and electrical circuits.

### Hands-On Abilities

Excellent communication skills, the ability to work independently, and a proactive approach to problem-solving are crucial. Your hands-on abilities will be put to the test as you tackle complex problems and provide practical solutions in real-time.
