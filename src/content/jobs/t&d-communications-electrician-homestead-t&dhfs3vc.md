## What You'll Do as an Electrician

At T&D Communications in Homestead, FL, our Electricians are the backbone of our operations, ensuring that all our electrical systems are installed and maintained with precision and safety. As an Electrician, you'll be diving into both new construction projects and renovations, working on everything from commercial buildings to industrial facilities. Your role is crucial in keeping the lights on and the power flowing smoothly. We pride ourselves on delivering top-notch service, and that's why we need skilled Electricians who can bring their expertise to our team.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician

You'll start your day reviewing blueprints and project plans to understand the scope of work. From there, you’ll be responsible for installing commercial electrical systems, such as switchgear, panels, and transformers. Your expertise with conduit is essential as you'll measure, cut, bend, and install EMT and rigid conduit with precision, ensuring everything aligns perfectly with the project specifications.

Once the conduits are in place, you'll pull and terminate wires, making sure that connections are secure and organized within conduits and boxes. Your keen eye for detail will come into play as you install and wire lighting fixtures, outlets, and power circuits, ensuring everything is functioning as it should. Testing and troubleshooting are also a big part of your day, where you'll use tools like multimeters to diagnose and fix any issues that arise.

Collaboration is key, so you'll often find yourself working alongside other trades to keep installations on track and within project timelines. Keeping your work area tidy, organized, and compliant with safety standards is a must. Additionally, you might be responsible for attending team meetings to discuss progress and plan for upcoming tasks.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician

To thrive in this role, you’ll need to be proficient with conduit benders and power tools, and have a deep understanding of NEC codes. Your ability to work on lifts and scaffolding is crucial, as well as possessing strong troubleshooting skills to handle any challenges that come your way. Experience with lighting control systems is a plus, and as an experienced Electrician, you'll be expected to mentor apprentices, passing on your knowledge and expertise.

We’re looking for candidates with 3-5 years of experience in the field. Must-have skills include a solid understanding of electrical systems, hands-on experience with installations, and the ability to work independently while meeting project deadlines.

## Compensation

At T&D Communications, we offer a competitive salary range between $32.99 and $41.03 per hour, depending on your experience and skills. We believe in supporting our team, which is why we provide career advancement opportunities, ongoing training, and certifications to help you grow in your career. Our benefits package is designed to support you both professionally and personally, ensuring you have everything you need to succeed as an Electrician with us.
