## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician with ChargePoint, you'll be embarking on a dynamic journey in the electrical field, contributing to the growing infrastructure of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Lakewood, CA, and its neighboring cities such as Long Beach, Bellflower, and Paramount. Your role is pivotal in ensuring that our projects run smoothly and efficiently. You'll be working alongside skilled journeymen and foremen, who will guide you in honing your skills in a real-world setting. This is an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience and develop your electrical expertise.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

### Assist in Installation and Maintenance

Your primary responsibility will be to assist in the installation and maintenance of EV charging stations. You'll work closely with journeymen and foremen to ensure all tasks adhere to the National Electrical Code (NEC) and California Electric Code standards. Daily, you'll pull and secure electrical wiring through conduits, trenches, and walls, ensuring everything is labeled and organized properly.

### Conduit Bending and Installation

Under supervision, you'll participate in conduit bending (EMT, rigid) and installation. You'll learn the intricacies of running conduit lines and securing them to meet job specifications. This task is crucial in laying the groundwork for a safe and efficient electrical system.

### Equipment Installation and Troubleshooting

You'll assist in the installation of service panels, transformers, and EV charging equipment. Additionally, you will perform basic troubleshooting tasks and system testing under the guidance of licensed electricians, allowing you to develop a practical understanding of diagnosing and resolving electrical issues.

### Site Maintenance and Safety

Maintaining cleanliness and organization on the job site is essential. You'll be responsible for the proper storage of tools, materials, and equipment. You'll also attend daily safety meetings and adhere to all workplace safety protocols. Documenting daily work progress and reporting any safety or operational issues to supervisors is a key part of your role.

### Learning and Supporting

You'll learn and implement proper techniques for wire terminations, conduit layout, and electrical system components. Proactively support team members in achieving project milestones and deadlines, and engage in 2-3 common activities such as assisting with tool maintenance and preparing materials for the next day's work.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To thrive in this role, you must possess a valid Electrical Trainee card from the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR). A basic understanding of electrical systems, tools, and equipment is crucial. Familiarity with NEC and California Electric Code is a plus, but a strong willingness to learn and develop skills under the supervision of experienced electricians is essential. Reliable transportation to job sites and the ability to work across multiple locations are necessary. Having OSHA 10-hour certification and First Aid/CPR is preferred. You'll need physical stamina to perform manual labor, including lifting up to 50 pounds and working on ladders or in confined spaces.

## Compensation

We offer a competitive salary range of $20.14-$25.96 per hour, depending on your experience. You'll have ample opportunities for career advancement and ongoing training and certifications. We believe in investing in our team, providing you with the tools and knowledge you need to succeed and grow in your career as an Apprentice Electrician.
