Welcome to Oak Electrical, where we're on the lookout for a skilled Fire Alarm Installer to join our team in Chesapeake, VA. Nestled between Virginia Beach, Norfolk, and Portsmouth, Chesapeake offers a vibrant community and a fantastic place to work and live. If you're passionate about ensuring safety through top-notch fire alarm installations, we'd love to hear from you!

## Qualifications

We're seeking someone who gets fire alarm systems inside and out. You'll need a solid understanding of initiating devices and notification appliances. Experience with Notifier, Simplex, or Edwards systems would really set you apart. While a NICET Level I certification is preferred, it's not a deal-breaker if you don't have it. However, you'll need to have OSHA-10 and First Aid/CPR certifications under your belt. It's essential that you're familiar with NFPA 72, can read blueprints like a pro, and have a handle on basic electricity. A clean driving record and the ability to pass a background check are must-haves. Plus, after you've settled in, you'll join our on-call rotation.

## Key Responsibilities

Your main gig will be installing fire alarm devices and pulling wire. You'll also lend a hand with system testing and keep all documentation up to date. Troubleshooting will be part of your role too, so you'll need to be ready to tackle any challenges that come your way.

## Compensation & Benefits

- **Salary Range:** $23.35-$31.28 per hour
- Dive into a comprehensive benefits package
- We offer plenty of opportunities for career advancement
- Keep your skills sharp with ongoing training and certifications

If this sounds like the kind of role you've been searching for, we can't wait to meet you! Join us at Oak Electrical, and let's make a difference in fire safety together.
