Hey there! We're Enhanced Voice & Data, and we're thrilled to be on the hunt for a talented Commercial Apprentice to join our team right here in Grove City, OH. If you've got a knack for all things electrical and you're eager to dive into some exciting large-scale construction projects, you might just be the person we're looking for. Our work isn't just limited to Grove City—our projects take us to nearby areas like Columbus, Hilliard, and Galloway too. So, if you're ready to make your mark across these cities, keep reading!

## Key Responsibilities

As our Commercial Apprentice, you'll be right in the thick of things, learning and growing your skills. You'll be designing and installing complete electrical systems, calculating load requirements, and coordinating with our talented BIM teams. Supervising installation crews and implementing lighting control systems will also be part of your day-to-day. You'll manage project material logistics, perform system commissioning, and install emergency power systems, all while coordinating with mechanical trades and programming building automation interfaces. Mentoring junior technicians will be another rewarding aspect of your role. 

Here in Grove City, we're gearing up for a big project—an exciting new commercial complex that's set to reshape the skyline. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor and be part of something special. Ohio has its own set of regional requirements, and you’ll be ensuring that all electrical installations meet state standards, including specific energy codes and safety regulations. Plus, you'll be working in collaboration with local utilities to ensure seamless integration of our systems.

## Required Qualifications

To be the perfect fit for this role, you'll need a journeyman electrical license and some solid experience with BIM coordination. Expertise in lighting controls and proven project management skills are key. You should also have certifications for multiple lift types and strong leadership abilities. A good grasp of energy codes and proficiency with building automation systems will set you apart. Safety is a big deal to us, so demonstrated safety management skills are a must.

For an apprentice role in the commercial setting, we're looking for someone with 0-3 years of experience. Since we're in Grove City, having familiarity with Ohio's local building codes and regulations will give you an edge. If you've got some experience working on projects in the Columbus area, that's a bonus too!

## Compensation & Benefits

We believe in taking care of our team, and that starts with offering a competitive salary ranging from $20.52 to $27.20 per hour, depending on your experience. We've got you covered with comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays to keep you refreshed and recharged. We're big on career advancement opportunities, so you'll have plenty of chances to grow and upskill with ongoing training and certifications.

If this sounds like the perfect next step in your career, we'd love to hear from you. Join us at Enhanced Voice & Data, and let's build a brighter future together!
