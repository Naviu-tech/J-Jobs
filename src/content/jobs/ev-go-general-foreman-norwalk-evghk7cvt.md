## What You'll Do as a General Foreman

As a General Foreman at EV GO, you'll play a pivotal role in leading our ambitious multi-year project in Norwalk, CA, with opportunities to extend your expertise to neighboring cities such as Cerritos, Bellflower, Santa Fe Springs, and Downey. Your day-to-day will center around the seamless execution of civil works for electric vehicle (EV) charging station installations. This position is all about being hands-on and ensuring that the project not only meets but exceeds standards and expectations.

## Your Daily Tasks as a General Foreman

Your daily duties will revolve around supervising and managing the civil scope of work for medium to large-scale electrical projects. You'll oversee multiple crews engaged in activities such as excavation, backfill, rebar installation, concrete pouring, bollard installation, and asphalt work. Reviewing and interpreting project plans, blueprints, and schematics will be second nature to you, ensuring compliance with design specifications and California Building Code standards.

You'll coordinate with project managers, subcontractors, and other teams to ensure that all work progresses on schedule, within budget, and meets quality expectations. Conducting milestone inspections, verifying adherence to safety standards, and implementing corrective actions as needed will be part of your routine. You'll also maintain daily reports detailing labor hours, resource usage, and project status.

Monitoring and enforcing compliance with SWIPPs will be crucial, ensuring environmental conditions like stormwater management and site cleanliness are upheld. Conducting regular toolbox talks and safety meetings will be essential to uphold a safety-first culture on site. Ensuring all crew certifications and equipment are current and compliant with governing standards is also under your purview.

You will collaborate with project leadership to address scope changes, track additional work, and maintain accurate documentation for contract variations. Additionally, youâ€™ll often find yourself troubleshooting on-site problems, ensuring that each challenge is met with a practical and effective solution.

## What You Need to Be a General Foreman

To thrive as a General Foreman, you'll need a minimum of 8-10 years of experience as a lead project foreman in commercial civil construction. A strong knowledge of the California Building Code and OSHA safety standards is essential. You should have a proven track record in leading teams through complex tasks such as excavation, concrete work, rebar installation, and asphalt laying.

Strong leadership, organizational, and problem-solving skills are a must, as well as proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite and familiarity with construction project management software like Site Tracker. A valid driver's license with a clean record and the ability to maintain coverage on company auto insurance is required. Additionally, OSHA 30-hour and First Aid/CPR certifications are preferred, highlighting your commitment to safety and preparedness.
