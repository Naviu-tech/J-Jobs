## The Fire Alarm Technician Position

As a Fire Alarm Technician at LEI Electrical, you'll be an integral part of a team that values precision and efficiency. Your day-to-day responsibilities will include installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting fire alarm systems across various settings, from commercial spaces to industrial complexes. You'll be part of a team that thrives on collaboration and technical expertise, supervised by seasoned professionals who provide guidance and support. Within LEI Electrical, there is ample opportunity for growth, whether you aspire to lead a team or specialize in a specific area of fire alarm technology. Our technicians enjoy a clear career path with opportunities to advance into supervisory or specialized technical roles.

## Core Fire Alarm Technician Responsibilities

Your role will encompass a wide range of technical duties, including the installation and programming of fire alarm control panels, rigorous testing of system functionality to ensure compliance with local fire codes, and thorough inspection and repair of devices such as smoke detectors and strobes. You will prepare detailed service reports and coordinate with building managers to schedule testing while training end-users on system operation. Advanced responsibilities include integrating fire alarm systems with building automation systems, conducting complex network troubleshooting, and implementing advanced programming for customized system operation. Our regional projects often involve unique challenges, such as retrofitting systems in historic buildings or coordinating installations in high-rise structures. Safety protocols are paramount; you'll adhere to strict guidelines to ensure your safety and that of your team, including the use of personal protective equipment and adherence to OSHA standards.

## Required Experience & Skills

To succeed in this role, you should have a minimum of 3-5 years of experience as a Fire Alarm Technician, with proven expertise in fire alarm systems and control panels. A deep understanding of local fire codes and regulations is essential, along with the ability to troubleshoot and resolve system issues efficiently. Familiarity with programming fire panels is preferred, and excellent communication skills are vital for effective interaction with clients and team members. Essential certifications include NICET Level II in Fire Alarm Systems, and a California State Fire Marshal card is highly advantageous. Your technical knowledge should encompass both conventional and addressable fire alarm systems, as well as a solid grounding in electrical theory and wiring.
