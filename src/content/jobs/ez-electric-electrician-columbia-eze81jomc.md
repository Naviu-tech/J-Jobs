Hey there! We’re EZ Electric, and we’re on the lookout for a talented Industrial Apprentice Electrician to join our team right here in Columbia, SC. Our gig involves working with automated manufacturing systems, and if you're up for the challenge, you’ll get to work in a vibrant city surrounded by places like Lexington, Irmo, and Cayce. At EZ Electric, we pride ourselves on our close-knit team and our commitment to getting the job done safely and efficiently. If you've got the skills and the drive, we’d love to hear from you!

## Key Responsibilities

In this role, you'll be diving into the nitty-gritty of installing and terminating 480V 3-phase power distribution systems. You'll get hands-on with precise conduit bending for complex industrial applications, and lend a hand with VFD and motor control installations. Preventive maintenance on manufacturing equipment? You got it. You'll also be using digital multimeters and meggars for testing, and keeping detailed maintenance logs. Assisting with PLC cabinet assembly is part of the gig, as well as following confined space and elevated work procedures. Plus, you’ll be supporting production equipment installations. Here in Columbia, you’ll also need to be familiar with local electrical codes and regulations. You might even find yourself troubleshooting systems specific to the manufacturing plants in the area, or coordinating with local utility providers to ensure seamless power integration.

## Required Qualifications

To thrive in this role, you’ll need your OSHA-30 certification tucked under your belt. Being able to read and interpret industrial electrical blueprints and P&IDs is a must. We’re looking for someone with a solid understanding of motor control circuits and experience with conduit bending machines up to 2". You should be proficient with digital testing equipment and have strong mathematical skills for load calculations. Safe use of hand and power tools is crucial, as is an understanding of industrial network infrastructure. We’re after someone with 1-3 years of experience in an industrial setting. Given our location, familiarity with South Carolina’s specific electrical safety standards is a plus. Experience with the types of automated systems commonly used in Columbia's manufacturing sectors will definitely set you apart.

## Compensation & Benefits

We believe in rewarding hard work with competitive pay, so our salary range is $24.17-$31.63 per hour, depending on your experience. We’ve got you covered with comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, along with paid time off and holidays to relax and recharge. At EZ Electric, there are plenty of opportunities for career advancement, and we’re committed to providing ongoing training and certifications to help you grow your skills.

If you’re ready to light up your career with us and take on exciting challenges in the heart of South Carolina, we can’t wait to meet you!
