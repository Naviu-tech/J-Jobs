## What You'll Do as an Apprentice Electrician

As an Apprentice Electrician at Rex Moore Electric, you'll play a vital role in our ongoing and upcoming projects in Elk Grove, CA, and surrounding areas like Sacramento, Rancho Cordova, and Folsom. This is a hands-on position where you'll support the installation of cutting-edge electrical systems, focusing mainly on renewable energy solutions. You'll work closely with experienced electricians and technicians to develop your skills and gain valuable field experience. This role is perfect for those eager to learn and grow in the electrical trade.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Apprentice Electrician

Your day-to-day tasks as an Apprentice Electrician will include supporting the installation of solar panels, battery storage systems, and EV charging stations on both residential and commercial properties. You'll assist in running conduit, pulling wire, and connecting inverters to electrical panels. A key part of your role will involve learning to interpret system blueprints and layouts, particularly for renewable energy projects.

In addition to these core duties, you'll perform routine inspections and maintenance on installed systems to ensure they are operating at peak efficiency. You'll also monitor and troubleshoot system components under the guidance of senior technicians, ensuring compliance with local building codes and renewable energy guidelines. Maintaining a clean and organized work environment is crucial, including managing tools and materials on-site. You may also participate in safety meetings and training sessions to ensure a safe work environment for everyone on the team.

## What You Need to Be an Apprentice Electrician

To succeed as an Apprentice Electrician, you should have a solid understanding of basic electrical concepts and a keen interest in renewable energy systems. An eagerness to learn about solar, battery, and EV charging technology is essential. You'll need to be comfortable working outdoors in various weather conditions and at heights, such as on rooftops. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail are a must, as is the willingness to travel between job sites and occasionally work extended hours.

While a high school diploma or equivalent is preferred, technical coursework in renewable energy is a plus. Ideally, you should have 1-4 years of experience in the field as an Apprentice Electrician. Must-have skills include proficiency in using electrical tools and equipment, the ability to read and interpret technical diagrams, and strong communication skills for working effectively with team members and supervisors.
