## What You'll Do as an Electrician Helper

Welcome to MMR Group in Tallahassee, FL! As an Electrician Helper, you'll be an essential part of our team, supporting skilled electricians on a variety of projects around the city. We’re known for tackling diverse and significant electrical installations, ensuring every building is powered efficiently and safely. Your role will be hands-on and dynamic, providing you with a solid foundation in the electrical trade. Expect to be actively involved in daily operations, assisting our electricians and making sure every project runs smoothly.

## Your Daily Tasks as an Electrician Helper

As an Electrician Helper, your day will be filled with a range of supportive tasks. You'll start by pulling wires through conduit systems, ensuring they are securely and neatly arranged. Cutting and preparing conduit will become second nature, as will mounting electrical boxes in precise locations. You'll organize and prepare the materials and tools needed for each task, which will keep the workflow efficient and reduce downtime.

You'll assist in assembling light fixtures and basic electrical components, learning the ins and outs of electrical systems. Maintaining cleanliness and organization on the job site will be crucial, and you'll take pride in removing debris and ensuring all tools and materials are stored safely and returned to their proper locations. You’ll also provide general assistance with measurements and marking layouts, following the guidance of our experienced electricians. Additionally, you might find yourself helping with troubleshooting minor electrical issues or conducting routine checks to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

## What You Need to Be an Electrician Helper

To thrive as an Electrician Helper, you'll need a basic understanding of hand tools such as pliers and screwdrivers. Your ability to follow instructions accurately and your strong physical stamina will be vital in keeping up with the demands of the job. Reliability and a solid work ethic are must-haves, as is a keen awareness of safety protocols when handling materials and equipment. While 0-2 years of experience in the field is ideal, we value hands-on abilities and a willingness to learn above all. Familiarity with basic electrical concepts and strong problem-solving skills will also set you apart.

## Compensation

At MMR Group, we offer a competitive salary range of $16.57-$20.06 per hour, depending on your experience and skill level. We believe in nurturing talent, so there are ample career advancement opportunities for those who demonstrate dedication and aptitude. Our team benefits from ongoing training and certifications, ensuring you stay current with the latest practices and technologies in the electrical field. We also provide comprehensive benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off, to support your well-being both on and off the job. With MMR Group, you’re not just taking a job—you’re building a career.
