## What You'll Do as a Switchgear Technician

As a Switchgear Technician at Burdett Hill, you'll play a pivotal role in our multi-year project located in Knotts Island, NC, with additional projects extending to nearby areas such as Currituck, Moyock, and Southern Shores. Your everyday tasks will center around maintaining the electrical systems that power our infrastructure, ensuring they function efficiently and safely. This role is perfect for someone who enjoys hands-on work and has a keen eye for detail, as you'll be involved in both the installation and troubleshooting of switchgear systems.

## Your Daily Tasks as a Switchgear Technician

As part of our team, you'll be responsible for the installation, maintenance, and testing of both low and medium voltage switchgear systems. This includes performing routine inspections and servicing to ensure optimal performance and safety. On any given day, you might find yourself troubleshooting a technical issue in the field or back at the shop, where you'll use your analytical skills to diagnose and resolve problems efficiently. You'll also be expected to train personnel on the proper maintenance and testing of power distribution equipment, ensuring that all staff are capable and knowledgeable. Collaborating closely with our clients is another key aspect of the role, where you'll provide technical support and work together to identify solutions that meet their needs. All of this must be done in line with NETA, IEEE, and NEMA standards, and you'll be preparing detailed reports on the work completed to document and communicate the outcomes effectively.

The job requires frequent travel and the ability to work at heights, so flexibility and a comfort with varied environments is important. Strong organizational and communication skills are a must, as you'll need to manage multiple tasks and communicate effectively with both team members and clients. Additionally, we require at least five years of experience in the field as a Switchgear Technician, demonstrating a proven track record of reliability and skill. Key skills include proficiency in reading electrical schematics, a solid understanding of electrical safety regulations, and an ability to work independently and as part of a team.
