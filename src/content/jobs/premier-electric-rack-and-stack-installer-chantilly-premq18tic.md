### What You'll Do

Hey team, we're looking for a Rack and Stack Installer to join Premier Electric in Chantilly, VA. If you're comfortable with hands-on assembly, know your way around a construction site, and have an eye for safety, we want to hear from you. You'll be diving into assembling and securing server racks in data centers, following blueprints, and ensuring everything's in its right place. Youâ€™ll be working closely with a supportive crew to install equipment into racks, manage tools, and keep things tidy and safe. 

### Why This Role is Exciting

Imagine being part of a team that keeps the digital world running smoothly. Your work will directly impact how data centers operate, and you'll collaborate with experienced professionals who share a passion for getting the job done right. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities to learn as you explore different locations in Chantilly and the surrounding areas. 

This role is just the beginning. With 1-3 years of experience, you'll earn between $18.87 and $21.71 per hour, enjoy comprehensive benefits, and have access to training that paves the way for growth. Plus, we provide all the tools and equipment you need to succeed.

### Responsibilities

- Ensure cable pathways are clear and accessible.
- Perform basic quality checks.
- Maintain cleanliness and safety on the job site.

### What We Are Looking For

We're after folks with hands-on construction or mechanical assembly experience. Familiarity with basic hand tools like drills, wrenches, and levels is a must. You should be able to lift up to 50 lbs and have a keen eye for detail. A good communicator and a team player? Even better. Reliable transportation and punctuality will keep you on track for success.
