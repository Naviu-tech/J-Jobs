A fish tape is a specialized tool used predominantly within the electrical industry to guide and pull electrical wiring through conduits, walls, and other enclosed spaces. It is typically composed of a long, flexible metal or fiberglass strip that can be extended and retracted from a reel. The fish tape is designed to be pushed through a confined space until it reaches an accessible point, where a wire can then be attached and pulled back through. This tool is essential for electricians, allowing them to efficiently and effectively install wiring in environments where direct access is difficult or impossible.

## Common Applications

### Electrical Wiring Installation
Fish tapes are primarily used in the installation of electrical wiring. They facilitate the routing of wires through conduits and behind walls, ceilings, and floors, which is particularly important in both new construction and renovation projects.

### Telecommunications and Data Cables
Beyond electrical wiring, fish tapes are also employed in the installation of telecommunications and network data cables. This includes running cables for telephone lines, internet connections, and other low-voltage systems.

### Audio and Video Cables
In addition to electrical and data cables, fish tapes can be used to route audio and video cables through walls and conduits, ensuring a clean and professional appearance for home theater or commercial audiovisual setups.

## Safety Considerations

### Electrical Hazards
When using a fish tape, it's crucial to be aware of potential electrical hazards. Ensure the power is turned off in the area where you are working to prevent accidental electrical shock.

### Tool Handling
Fish tapes can recoil unexpectedly, especially when retracting the tape back into the reel. Handle the tool carefully to avoid injury from the sharp metal edges or sudden movements.

### Workspace Safety
Maintain a clear workspace to prevent tripping over the tape or other tools. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any debris that might be dislodged during the process.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Conduit
A conduit is a tube or trough for protecting electrical wiring. Fish tapes are often used to route wires through conduits.

### Pull Line
A pull line, or pull string, is another tool used in conjunction with fish tapes for pulling wires over long distances, especially in large commercial installations.

### Cable Snake
Similar in function to a fish tape, a cable snake is another type of tool used to route cables through confined spaces, often made of a more flexible material like nylon.

### Wire Puller
A wire puller is a device that assists in pulling wire through conduit, often used in conjunction with a fish tape for more challenging installations.
