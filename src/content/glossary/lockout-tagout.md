Lockout/Tagout is a critical safety procedure used in the electrical and various other industries to ensure that dangerous machines are completely powered down and unable to be restarted while maintenance or repair work is being performed. The process involves two primary components: 'Lockout' which refers to the physical locking of power sources to prevent re-energization, and 'Tagout' which involves attaching a clearly visible tag to the locked device to indicate that it should not be turned on. This procedure is vital for protecting workers from the unexpected startup of machinery or release of hazardous energy during service activities.

## Common Applications

### Industrial Settings
Lockout/Tagout is frequently applied in manufacturing plants, refineries, and other industrial environments where heavy machinery and equipment are prevalent. These procedures are crucial during routine maintenance, repairs, or upgrades.

### Construction Sites
On construction sites, Lockout/Tagout ensures that equipment such as cranes, bulldozers, and other machinery are safely de-energized before any maintenance work is carried out.

### Utility Services
In utilities, including water, electricity, and gas services, Lockout/Tagout procedures are used to ensure that pipelines, electrical circuits, and other systems are safely shut down and remain so during service work.

## Safety Considerations

### Training and Awareness
All employees involved in maintenance or servicing activities must be thoroughly trained in Lockout/Tagout procedures to ensure they understand the importance and correct execution of these safety measures.

### Compliance
Adhering to regulatory standards such as OSHA in the United States is essential for ensuring safe and compliant Lockout/Tagout procedures. Regular audits and reviews of procedures can help maintain compliance and safety.

### Equipment Inspection
Regular inspection of lockout devices and tags is necessary to ensure their effectiveness. Any damaged or worn-out equipment should be replaced immediately to maintain safety standards.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Energy Isolation
Energy Isolation refers to the act of physically preventing the release of energy from a machine or system, which is a core component of Lockout/Tagout procedures.

### Hazardous Energy
Hazardous Energy encompasses any electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, or other energy sources that pose risks during maintenance or servicing activities.

### Tagout
Tagout is the component of the procedure that involves placing a tag on the locked machinery or equipment. The tag includes information about the maintenance work being done and serves as a warning not to re-energize the device.

### Authorized Employee
An Authorized Employee is a person who has received the necessary training and is permitted to perform Lockout/Tagout procedures on machinery or equipment.
