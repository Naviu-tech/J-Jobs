Display Mount refers to a structural support system specifically designed for the secure attachment of display screens such as televisions, monitors, or digital signage to walls or ceilings. These mounts are engineered to provide stable and aesthetically pleasing installations, ensuring that displays are both functional and visually integrated into their environment. Proper installation of a display mount requires careful consideration of the mounting surface to ensure adequate backing is present to support the weight and size of the display. Additionally, the installation process must account for the placement of power and signal cables, often involving conduits to conceal and protect these connections, maintaining a clean appearance and preventing potential damage.

## Common Applications

### Residential Use
Display mounts are commonly used in homes for mounting televisions in living rooms, bedrooms, or home theaters. They allow for optimal viewing angles and save space by eliminating the need for bulky furniture.

### Commercial Settings
In offices, conference rooms, and retail environments, display mounts are used to install monitors and digital signage for presentations, advertisements, or informational displays. They provide a professional appearance and ensure that screens are securely positioned.

### Public Spaces
Display mounts are also utilized in public areas such as airports, train stations, and stadiums to hold large digital screens that convey important announcements, schedules, or advertisements to large audiences.

## Safety Considerations

### Load Capacity
Ensure that the display mount selected is rated to support the weight of the display being installed. Exceeding the load capacity can lead to mount failure and potential injury or damage to the display.

### Secure Installation
Proper installation is crucial to prevent the mount from detaching from the wall or ceiling. This includes using the appropriate hardware and ensuring that the mount is attached to structural elements capable of supporting the weight.

### Cable Management
Secure and conceal power and signal cables to prevent tripping hazards and to protect cables from damage. Using conduits or cable management systems can help achieve this.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### VESA Mounting Standard
A standard used to determine the placement of the mounting holes on the back of a display, ensuring compatibility with various mounts.

### Articulating Mount
A type of display mount that allows for movement and adjustment of the display, providing flexibility in viewing angles.

### Fixed Mount
A basic type of display mount that holds the display in a fixed position without the ability to adjust or tilt.

### Ceiling Mount
A specific type of display mount designed for attachment to ceilings, often used in rooms with limited wall space or for overhead displays.
