Smoke control refers to a sophisticated set of strategies and systems designed to manage the movement of smoke within a building during a fire. These systems are typically integrated with the building's Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and the fire alarm system to optimize safety and visibility for occupants and emergency responders. By controlling smoke spread, these systems help maintain safe evacuation paths, protect property, and facilitate firefighting efforts. Smoke control can include active systems, such as fans and dampers that adjust the airflow, and passive systems, such as smoke barriers that contain smoke to specific areas.

## Common Applications

### Commercial Buildings
In commercial buildings like office towers and shopping malls, smoke control systems are crucial for managing smoke movement in large atriums and extended corridors, ensuring occupants can safely evacuate.

### High-rise Residential Buildings
Smoke control systems are essential in high-rise residential buildings to prevent smoke from moving vertically through stairwells and elevator shafts, which are critical evacuation routes.

### Industrial Facilities
In industrial environments, smoke control systems are used to protect sensitive equipment and maintain a safe environment for workers, minimizing downtime and damage to assets.

## Safety Considerations

### System Reliability
Smoke control systems must be highly reliable, with regular maintenance and testing to ensure they function correctly during an emergency. This includes checking the integrity of smoke barriers and the operability of fans and dampers.

### Integration with Fire Alarm Systems
Proper integration with fire alarm systems is crucial so that smoke control measures are automatically activated during a fire, ensuring immediate response without manual intervention.

### Compliance with Regulations
Smoke control systems must comply with local and international fire safety standards and codes, which dictate system design, installation, and performance criteria.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Smoke Management
A broader term encompassing all methods and strategies to control smoke movement in a building, including both smoke control and smoke containment.

### Pressurization
A specific smoke control technique where stairwells, elevator shafts, and other critical areas are kept at higher pressure than surrounding spaces to prevent smoke infiltration.

### Smoke Dampers
These are mechanical devices installed within ductwork or walls that automatically close or open to prevent the passage of smoke through the HVAC system or building compartments.

### Smoke Barriers
Structures within a building designed to restrict the movement of smoke, such as walls or partitions that meet certain fire-resistance ratings.
