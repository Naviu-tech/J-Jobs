A panel board, also known as a distribution board or breaker panel, is a critical component of an electrical distribution system. It serves as a central point where electricity is distributed from a single input source to multiple circuits, each of which is protected by circuit breakers or fuses. This ensures that in the event of an overload or short circuit, only the affected circuit is disconnected, minimizing the risk of damage and ensuring the continuity of service for the remaining circuits. Panel boards are an essential part of both residential and commercial electrical systems, providing a means to organize and manage electrical connections efficiently. They are typically housed in a metal enclosure and come equipped with a door for safety and aesthetic purposes.

## Common Applications

### Residential Use
In homes, panel boards are used to distribute power throughout the house. They are generally located in basements, utility rooms, or garages and control lighting, appliance circuits, and other household electrical needs.

### Commercial and Industrial Use
In commercial and industrial settings, panel boards handle higher voltage levels and are often part of a larger electrical distribution system. They are used to control power distribution to various areas within a building, such as office spaces, manufacturing floors, and specialized equipment.

## Safety Considerations

### Overcurrent Protection
Panel boards are equipped with circuit breakers or fuses that provide overcurrent protection. This helps prevent electrical fires and equipment damage by interrupting the flow of electricity in the event of an overload or short circuit.

### Proper Installation and Maintenance
It is crucial that panel boards are installed and maintained by qualified electricians to ensure they operate safely and effectively. Regular inspections can help identify potential issues before they become hazardous.

### Grounding and Bonding
Proper grounding and bonding are essential for ensuring the safety of a panel board. These measures help prevent electrical shock and ensure that fault currents are safely carried away from the panel board.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Circuit Breaker
A switch that automatically interrupts electrical flow in a circuit in the event of an overload or short circuit. Circuit breakers can be reset, unlike fuses, which must be replaced once they have blown.

### Fuse
A safety device that protects electrical circuits by melting and breaking the circuit when excessive current flows through it. Once a fuse has operated, it must be replaced.

### Main Service Panel
The primary distribution point for electrical circuits in a building. It contains the main circuit breaker that controls the flow of electricity from the utility provider to the building.

### Subpanel
A smaller panel board that extends the electrical distribution system, typically used to serve a specific area of a building, such as a garage or basement. Subpanels are connected to the main service panel and provide additional circuit capacity.
