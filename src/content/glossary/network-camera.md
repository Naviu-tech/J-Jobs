A Network Camera, also known as an IP camera, is a type of digital video camera commonly used for surveillance. Unlike analog closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, network cameras transmit data over a computer network rather than a direct connection to a recording device. This allows for the integration of video surveillance into existing IT infrastructures. Network cameras are equipped with their own IP addresses, enabling them to send video streams over the internet or local networks. These cameras can often provide high-resolution video, support for pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) functions, and advanced features like motion detection, night vision, and remote accessibility. With built-in processing power, they can also support video analytics, which can be used for various purposes such as identifying license plates, recognizing faces, or monitoring crowd density.

## Common Applications

### Residential Security
Network cameras are frequently used in residential settings for home security. They allow homeowners to monitor their property remotely via smartphones, tablets, or computers. Features like motion detection and alerts can notify users of unusual activity.

### Commercial Surveillance
In commercial environments, network cameras are used for monitoring areas such as retail stores, offices, and warehouses. They help deter theft, ensure employee safety, and manage operational efficiency.

### Public Safety
Network cameras play a critical role in public safety by monitoring streets, parks, and other public areas. They aid law enforcement agencies in crime prevention and investigation by providing real-time data and recorded evidence.

### Industrial Monitoring
In industrial settings, network cameras are used to monitor production lines, ensure safety compliance, and prevent accidents. They are also used to oversee critical infrastructure and facilities.

## Safety Considerations

### Data Privacy
Given that network cameras transmit video over networks, it is crucial to secure these data streams to prevent unauthorized access. This can be achieved through encryption, secure password policies, and regular firmware updates.

### Network Security
Network cameras can be vulnerable to cyberattacks if not properly secured. It is important to use firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems to protect the network infrastructure.

### Physical Security
The physical security of network cameras is also important to prevent tampering or vandalism. Proper installation and the use of secure mounting options can mitigate these risks.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television)
A traditional surveillance system that uses analog cameras connected directly to recording devices. Unlike network cameras, CCTV systems do not typically support remote access or integration with network infrastructure.

### Video Analytics
Advanced software features that can be integrated with network cameras to analyze video content in real time. This includes functionalities such as motion detection, facial recognition, and behavioral analysis.

### PoE (Power over Ethernet)
A technology that allows network cameras to receive power and data through a single Ethernet cable. This simplifies installation and reduces the need for additional power outlets.

### Cloud Storage
Many network cameras offer the option to store video footage in the cloud, providing scalable storage solutions and easy access to recorded data from anywhere with an internet connection.
