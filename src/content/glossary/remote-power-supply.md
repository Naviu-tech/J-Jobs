A Remote Power Supply (RPS) in the fire alarm industry refers to an auxiliary power source that is used to supply electrical power to notification appliances or other devices that are located at a significant distance from the main Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP). These devices include horns, strobes, speakers, and other alarms that require electricity to operate effectively in an emergency situation. The RPS ensures that these devices receive adequate power to function reliably, maintaining the integrity of the fire alarm system throughout a facility. The use of a remote power supply is crucial in large buildings or campuses where the distance from the main FACP could result in voltage drop, potentially affecting the performance and reliability of connected devices.

## Common Applications

### Large Commercial Buildings

In expansive facilities such as shopping malls, hospitals, and office complexes, the use of remote power supplies is essential to ensure that all parts of the building have access to sufficient power for the fire alarm system's notification appliances.

### Campus Environments

University campuses and industrial parks with multiple buildings spread over a vast area often utilize remote power supplies to maintain effective communication and alarm systems across all buildings.

### High-Rise Buildings

In high-rise buildings, remote power supplies help overcome the challenges posed by vertical distances, ensuring that alarms and notification devices function correctly on every floor.

## Safety Considerations

### Compliance with Standards

Remote power supplies must comply with national and local fire safety standards and codes, such as NFPA 72, to ensure they are installed and maintained correctly. This compliance ensures the safety and reliability of the fire alarm system.

### Regular Maintenance

Regular testing and maintenance of remote power supplies are crucial to ensure they are functioning correctly and are ready to operate in an emergency. This includes checking battery health and connections.

### Backup Battery Systems

Incorporating backup battery systems within the remote power supply ensures that the fire alarm system remains operational in the event of a power outage, providing an additional layer of safety.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP)

The central hub of a fire alarm system that monitors inputs and controls outputs, including notification devices and remote power supplies.

### Notification Appliances

Devices such as horns, strobes, and speakers that alert building occupants of a fire or emergency event.

### Voltage Drop

A reduction in voltage in an electrical circuit between the source and load, which can affect device performance, especially in systems with long cable runs.

### Power Boosters

Devices used to amplify the power output to notification appliances to ensure consistent operation across a fire alarm system, often used in conjunction with remote power supplies.
