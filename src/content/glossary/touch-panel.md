A touch panel is an interactive control interface used in the Audio Visual (AV) industry to manage and operate various systems and devices. These panels are designed to be either wall-mounted or placed on a tabletop, providing a centralized point of interaction for users to control AV equipment such as projectors, screens, sound systems, and lighting. Touch panels rely on touch-sensitive screens that allow users to navigate through menus and make selections with the touch of a finger. To function effectively, touch panels require a reliable power source, data connectivity, and proper installation within a suitable mounting box. This ensures stable operation and integration with the broader AV system.
