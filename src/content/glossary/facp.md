Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP) is the central component of a fire alarm system, serving as the key interface between the various elements that detect and respond to fire incidents. It is responsible for monitoring inputs from initiating devices such as smoke detectors, heat detectors, and manual pull stations. Upon receiving a signal indicating a potential fire hazard, the FACP processes this information and activates output devices like alarms, sirens, or notification appliances to alert occupants. Additionally, the FACP can trigger other fire safety measures, such as releasing fire doors, controlling elevators, and initiating HVAC shutdowns to prevent the spread of smoke and fire. Advanced FACPs often include features for system diagnostics, event logging, and network communication to ensure comprehensive fire safety management.

## Common Applications

### Commercial Buildings
FACPs are commonly installed in commercial buildings such as office complexes, shopping malls, and hotels. They are crucial for ensuring the safety of occupants and aiding in the organization of evacuation procedures.

### Industrial Facilities
In industrial settings, FACPs help protect valuable machinery and inventory by rapidly detecting the presence of fire and coordinating an appropriate response.

### Residential Complexes
Large residential buildings and complexes often use FACPs to centralize the management of fire detection systems across multiple units or floors.

### Healthcare Facilities
Hospitals and care homes use FACPs to ensure patient safety, where quick evacuation and fire containment are critical.

## Safety Considerations

### Regular Maintenance
FACPs require regular testing and maintenance to ensure they function properly during an emergency. This includes checking battery backups, inspecting wiring, and updating software.

### Compliance with Standards
Installation and operation of FACPs must comply with local and national fire safety standards, such as those set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

### User Training
Personnel responsible for fire safety should be trained to operate the FACP, including silencing alarms, resetting the system, and interpreting system alerts.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Initiating Devices
Components such as smoke detectors and manual pull stations that provide input signals to the FACP.

### Notification Appliances
Output devices like alarms and strobes that are activated by the FACP to alert building occupants.

### Addressable Fire Alarm System
A type of fire alarm system where each device has a unique address, allowing the FACP to pinpoint the exact location of a fire or fault.

### Zoned Fire Alarm System
A system where the FACP divides the building into distinct zones, enabling targeted responses to fire incidents in specific areas.

### Backup Power Supply
An auxiliary power source for the FACP, ensuring continued operation during power outages.
