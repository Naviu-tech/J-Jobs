A Mag Door Holder, or Magnetic Door Holder, is an electromagnetic device designed to keep fire doors open under normal conditions. The device holds the door in place by using an electromagnet that is energized to create a magnetic field, allowing the door to remain open. In the event of a fire alarm activation or power failure, the electromagnet deactivates, releasing the door to close automatically. This mechanism ensures that fire barriers are maintained, preventing the spread of smoke and fire throughout a building. Mag Door Holders are an integral part of fire safety systems in many commercial and institutional buildings, providing a balance between accessibility and safety.

## Common Applications

- **Commercial Buildings**: Often used in office buildings to keep doors open for ease of movement while still maintaining fire safety.
- **Hospitals**: Utilized to hold doors open in corridors for quick access and ease of transport for patients, while ensuring doors can close automatically in an emergency.
- **Schools and Universities**: Installed in educational institutions to facilitate smooth movement between classrooms and corridors while preserving fire safety measures.
- **Hotels**: Employed in hallways and common areas to enhance accessibility for guests, with the ability to close doors promptly during a fire event.

## Safety Considerations

- **Regular Maintenance**: Mag Door Holders require periodic maintenance checks to ensure they function correctly and release doors as required during a fire alarm.
- **Compatibility with Fire Alarm Systems**: It's crucial that Mag Door Holders are integrated with the building's fire alarm system to ensure they deactivate promptly during an emergency.
- **Power Supply**: They should be connected to a reliable power source with backup options, such as battery or generator, to ensure functionality during power outages.
- **Testing Protocols**: Routine testing should be conducted to verify the door holders release doors as intended during fire drills or alarm tests.

## Related Terms or Concepts

- **Fire Door**: A door with a fire-resistance rating, designed to prevent the spread of fire and smoke between compartments within a building.
- **Electromagnet**: A type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current, used in Mag Door Holders to maintain the open position of a door.
- **Fire Alarm System**: An integrated network of devices designed to detect and alert occupants of a building about the presence of fire.
- **Smoke Control System**: A series of engineered systems employed to control the spread of smoke within a building during a fire, often working in conjunction with fire doors and magnetic door holders.
