Voltage is a fundamental concept in the field of electrical engineering, representing the electrical pressure or potential difference between two points in an electrical circuit. It is the force that drives electric current through a conductor. Voltage is measured in units called volts, symbolized by "V". This potential difference is essential for the functioning of electrical devices and systems, as it enables the movement of electrons from one point to another, thus creating an electric current. Without voltage, there would be no current flow, and consequently, no electrical power to perform work.

## Common Applications

### Power Generation and Distribution
Voltage is crucial in power generation and distribution systems. It is generated at power plants and transmitted over long distances through power lines at high voltages to reduce energy loss, before being stepped down to safer levels for residential and commercial use.

### Electronics and Appliances
Consumer electronics and household appliances rely on specific voltage levels to function properly. Devices such as televisions, computers, and refrigerators are designed to operate at standard voltages provided by household electrical outlets.

### Industrial Machinery
In industrial settings, machinery often operates at various voltage levels to meet specific operational requirements. Voltage control is essential for the efficient and safe operation of industrial equipment.

## Safety Considerations

### Risk of Electric Shock
High voltage can pose significant safety risks, including electric shock, which can be fatal. It is crucial to handle electrical systems with care and adhere to safety protocols, such as using insulated tools and wearing protective gear.

### Equipment Damage
Incorrect voltage levels can damage electrical equipment, leading to malfunctions or permanent damage. It is important to ensure that devices are connected to appropriate voltage sources.

### Regulatory Standards
Compliance with regulatory standards is essential to ensure the safe use of voltage in various applications. Standards set by organizations like the National Electrical Code (NEC) provide guidelines for safe voltage handling.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Current
Current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor, driven by the voltage. It is measured in amperes (A) and is a key parameter in electrical circuits.

### Resistance
Resistance is the opposition to the flow of current in a conductor, measured in ohms (Ω). Together with voltage and current, it forms the basis of Ohm's Law, which describes the relationship between these three elements.

### Ohm's Law
Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering, expressed as V = I × R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance. It describes how voltage, current, and resistance are interrelated in an electrical circuit.
