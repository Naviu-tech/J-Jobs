An Electric Strike is an electronically controlled door locking mechanism designed to enhance security and access control within a facility. It functions by holding or releasing the latch of a door when authorized access credentials are presented or a remote release command is issued. Electric strikes are often integrated with access control systems, such as card readers, keypads, or biometric devices, to ensure that only individuals with proper authorization can gain entry. When a valid credential is detected, the electric strike momentarily releases the door latch, allowing the door to be opened without the need for manual key operation. This mechanism can also be activated from a remote location, providing an additional layer of convenience and security management.

## Common Applications

### Commercial Buildings
Electric strikes are widely used in office buildings, retail spaces, and other commercial environments where controlled access is essential for security and operational efficiency.

### Residential Complexes
In multi-unit residential buildings, electric strikes are employed to secure entry points such as main doors, parking garages, and individual apartment units.

### Educational Institutions
Schools and universities utilize electric strikes to control access to classrooms, laboratories, and administrative offices, ensuring that only authorized personnel and students can enter.

### Healthcare Facilities
Hospitals and clinics use electric strikes to secure sensitive areas such as medication storage rooms, patient records rooms, and restricted treatment areas.

## Safety Considerations

### Fire Safety Compliance
Electric strikes must comply with fire safety regulations, ensuring that they can be released manually or automatically in the event of an emergency to allow for safe evacuation.

### Tamper Resistance
To prevent unauthorized access attempts, electric strikes should be installed with tamper-resistant features and regularly inspected for any signs of wear or tampering.

### Power Supply and Backup
Electric strikes require a reliable power source to function. It is crucial to have a backup power supply, such as a battery, to ensure continued operation during power outages.

## Related Terms or Concepts
