Plenum cable is a specialized type of cable designed specifically for use in air-handling spaces, such as the plenum spaces found between the structural ceiling and a drop-down ceiling or under a raised floor. These spaces are often used to circulate air for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Plenum cables are constructed with fire-resistant materials that prevent the spread of flames and produce minimal smoke when exposed to high temperatures. This makes them suitable and often required by building codes for installation in plenum spaces, where the risk of fire hazards and smoke spreading is a significant concern.

## Common Applications

### Data and Communication Networks
Plenum cables are frequently used in settings that require the routing of data and communication lines through plenum spaces. This includes office buildings, schools, and hospitals where network cables need to be installed in areas that also serve as air circulation spaces.

### Audio-Visual Installations
In environments such as conference rooms, auditoriums, and theaters, plenum cables are used to connect audio-visual equipment. Their low smoke emission characteristic is crucial in ensuring safety in these public spaces.

### HVAC Systems
Plenum cables are also used within HVAC systems to connect and control various components, thanks to their ability to withstand the environmental conditions present in air-handling spaces.

## Safety Considerations

### Fire Safety
Plenum cables must comply with rigorous fire safety standards to ensure they do not contribute to the spread of fire within buildings. They are typically tested for their flame resistance and smoke production to meet the requirements of standards such as NFPA 262 or UL 910.

### Regulatory Compliance
Installers must ensure that plenum cables are used in accordance with local building codes and regulations, which often mandate their use in specific settings to enhance safety and reduce fire risks.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Non-Plenum Cable
Non-plenum cables, or PVC cables, are not suitable for use in plenum spaces due to their higher smoke and flame propagation characteristics. They are typically used in non-air-circulating spaces where these stringent fire safety features are not required.

### Riser Cable
Riser cables are designed for use in vertical spaces between floors, known as risers. While they also have fire-resistant properties, they are not as stringent as plenum cables and are not suitable for air-handling spaces.

### Flame Retardant
This term refers to materials or cables that have been treated or designed to resist burning and withstand heat. Plenum cables are a type of flame-retardant cable specifically rated for use in air-handling spaces.
