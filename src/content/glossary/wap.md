Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a networking device that enables wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or related standards. It acts as a bridge between the wired Ethernet network and wireless devices. A WAP transmits data between the wireless network and the wired network infrastructure, allowing users to connect to the network from any location within the access point's range. Structured cabling is essential to provide power and data connectivity to the WAP, ensuring that it can function effectively within a network setup.

## Common Applications

### Enterprise Networking
WAPs are widely used in enterprise environments to provide wireless connectivity across large office spaces. They enable employees to connect laptops, tablets, and smartphones to the corporate network without the need for physical cables.

### Public Wi-Fi
WAPs are deployed in public areas such as airports, cafes, and shopping malls to offer internet access to customers and visitors. These access points often serve a large number of users simultaneously.

### Home Networking
In residential settings, WAPs extend the coverage of a home network, allowing devices in various rooms to connect wirelessly to the internet or to each other.

## Safety Considerations

### Security
WAPs should be configured with strong security protocols such as WPA3 to prevent unauthorized access. Regular updates and the use of strong passwords are essential to maintain network security.

### Signal Interference
Wireless signals from WAPs can be subject to interference from other electronic devices. It's important to position WAPs in locations that minimize interference to maintain optimal performance.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### SSID (Service Set Identifier)
The name of the wireless network that is broadcasted by a WAP, allowing users to identify and connect to the correct network.

### WPA/WPA2/WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
Security protocols used to protect wireless networks, ensuring data transmitted over the network is encrypted.

### IEEE 802.11 Standards
A set of standards that define the operation of wireless access points and other wireless networking devices, ensuring compatibility and performance across different devices and manufacturers.
