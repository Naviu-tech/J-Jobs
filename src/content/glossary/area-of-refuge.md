An "Area of Refuge" is a designated safe zone within a building where individuals who are unable to evacuate independently during an emergency can wait for rescue or assistance. These areas are specifically designed to protect occupants from smoke and fire, and they are typically equipped with two-way communication systems to ensure constant contact with emergency personnel. This setup allows those in distress to convey their location and receive updates or instructions until help arrives. Areas of Refuge are crucial components in buildings, especially high-rises, healthcare facilities, and other structures where individuals with mobility impairments may be present. 

## Common Applications

### High-Rise Buildings
In multi-story buildings, Areas of Refuge provide a secure location for individuals who may not be able to use stairs during an evacuation, such as those with disabilities or injuries.

### Healthcare Facilities
Hospitals and care homes often incorporate Areas of Refuge to ensure that patients and individuals with limited mobility can remain safe during an emergency until assistance is provided.

### Educational Institutions
Schools and universities employ these areas to protect students, staff, and visitors who might be unable to evacuate quickly due to mobility challenges or other issues.

## Safety Considerations

### Communication Systems
Areas of Refuge must be equipped with reliable two-way communication systems. This ensures that individuals can alert emergency services to their presence and receive updates or instructions during an emergency.

### Fire and Smoke Protection
These areas should be designed to resist fire and prevent smoke infiltration, often through the use of fire-resistant materials and proper sealing.

### Accessibility
The location and design of Areas of Refuge must comply with accessibility standards and regulations, ensuring they are easily reachable by those with mobility impairments.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Evacuation Routes
Evacuation routes are pre-determined paths designed to facilitate the safe exit of building occupants during an emergency. Areas of Refuge are often integrated into these plans.

### Emergency Egress
This refers to the methods and routes available for occupants to exit a building during an emergency. Areas of Refuge provide a temporary solution for those unable to use typical egress options.

### Life Safety Systems
Life Safety Systems encompass all the measures and equipment used to protect building occupants during emergencies, including fire alarms, sprinklers, and Areas of Refuge.
