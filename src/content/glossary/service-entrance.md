Service Entrance refers to the critical point where electrical service conductors penetrate a building's boundary to deliver electrical energy from the utility provider to the building's internal electrical distribution system. This entry point typically comprises several key components: the service head, which is the weatherproof fitting that connects the overhead service drop to the service entrance conductors; the meter base, which houses the electric meter that records energy consumption; and the main disconnect components, which provide a means to safely disconnect power to the building for maintenance or emergency purposes. Together, these elements ensure that electricity is safely and efficiently delivered into the premises, ready for distribution to various circuits within the building.

## Common Applications

### Residential Buildings
In residential settings, the service entrance is typically located on an exterior wall, often near the utility pole or underground service conduit. It provides the homeowner with a central point for electrical metering and disconnection.

### Commercial and Industrial Buildings
Larger commercial and industrial facilities may have more complex service entrance installations, which can include multiple meter bases and larger main disconnects to handle increased electrical loads.

## Safety Considerations

### Installation and Maintenance
Proper installation and maintenance of the service entrance are crucial for safety. Only qualified electricians should perform work on or near the service entrance to prevent electrical hazards, such as shocks or fires.

### Weatherproofing
Ensuring that the service entrance is properly weatherproofed is essential to prevent moisture intrusion, which can lead to corrosion and electrical faults.

### Accessibility
The main disconnect should be easily accessible for emergency personnel to quickly cut off power in case of an emergency, such as a fire.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Service Drop
The overhead electrical line that runs from the utility pole to the service entrance.

### Service Lateral
An underground electrical line that connects the utilityâ€™s distribution system to the service entrance of a building.

### Metering
The process of measuring electricity consumption using an electric meter housed within the meter base.

### Main Disconnect
A device that allows for the manual or automatic disconnection of power from the service entrance to the rest of the building's electrical system.
