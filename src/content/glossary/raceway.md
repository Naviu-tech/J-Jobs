Raceway

A raceway is an enclosed conduit that is specifically designed to house and protect electrical wires and cables. It serves the dual purpose of providing a clean installation path for the wiring and allowing for easy access for future maintenance or upgrades. Raceways are integral components in electrical systems as they not only organize and conceal wires but also safeguard them from physical damage, environmental hazards, and unauthorized access. There are various types of raceways, including conduit, wireways, and cable trays, each suited to different applications and environments. The choice of raceway is influenced by factors such as the type of building, the environment in which the raceway will be installed, and specific electrical codes and regulations.

## Common Applications

### Commercial Buildings

In commercial settings, raceways are used to run electrical cables through walls, ceilings, and floors, ensuring a neat and organized installation. They are essential for managing the complex wiring systems found in office buildings, shopping centers, and other commercial facilities.

### Industrial Facilities

Industrial environments, which often involve heavy machinery and equipment, utilize raceways to protect critical electrical wiring from mechanical damage and harsh environmental conditions. They are crucial for maintaining operational safety and efficiency.

### Residential Installations

In residential settings, raceways are used to conceal electrical wiring in areas like basements and attics, as well as to facilitate clean cable runs for home entertainment systems and computer networks.

## Safety Considerations

- **Fire Resistance:** Raceways should be made of materials that are resistant to fire and meet the necessary safety standards to prevent the spread of fire through electrical systems.
- **Proper Sizing:** It is crucial to select the appropriate size of raceway to avoid overcrowding, which can lead to overheating and potential fire hazards.
- **Secure Installation:** Raceways must be securely fastened to prevent them from becoming dislodged or damaged, which could expose wires and create shock hazards.
- **Compliance with Codes:** Installations must comply with local, national, and international electrical codes and standards to ensure safety and reliability.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Conduit

A type of raceway that is typically a tube or trough for protecting electrical wiring. Conduits can be made from various materials, including metal and plastic, and are used for both concealed and exposed installations.

### Cable Tray

A support system used to hold and organize cables and raceways. Cable trays provide a flexible solution for managing large volumes of cables in industrial and commercial environments.

### Wireway

A type of raceway with a removable cover, allowing for easy access to the wires inside for maintenance and upgrades. Wireways are often used in control panels and other areas where frequent access is required.

### Trunking

A type of raceway that is often rectangular and used to distribute electrical wiring throughout a building. Trunking systems can be surface-mounted or recessed into walls for a cleaner appearance.
