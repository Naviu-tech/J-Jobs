Harmonics refer to distortions in the normal electrical sine wave, primarily caused by non-linear loads on the power system. These non-linear loads, such as variable frequency drives, fluorescent lighting, and other electronic equipment, draw current in abrupt pulses rather than in a smooth, sinusoidal manner. This irregular consumption pattern causes the original sine wave to deform, creating additional frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. The presence of harmonics can lead to various issues, including equipment malfunction, increased power consumption, and potential damage to electrical infrastructure. Harmonics can also contribute to overheating in transformers and motors, as well as cause interference in communication lines.

## Common Applications

### Industrial Environments
Harmonics are commonly associated with industrial environments where large numbers of non-linear loads are present, such as manufacturing plants with extensive use of variable frequency drives and rectifiers.

### Commercial Buildings
In commercial buildings, harmonics are introduced by office equipment, such as computers and fluorescent lighting, which can lead to power quality issues.

### Renewable Energy Systems
In renewable energy systems, particularly those involving inverters like solar and wind power systems, harmonics can affect power quality and efficiency.

## Safety Considerations

### Equipment Stress
Harmonics can increase the operational stress on electrical equipment, potentially leading to premature failure. Equipment designed to handle sinusoidal currents may overheat or suffer insulation breakdown due to excessive harmonics, posing a safety hazard.

### Electrical Fires
The excess heat generated by harmonics can increase the risk of electrical fires, particularly in wiring and transformers not designed to handle such distortions.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
A quantifiable measure of the extent of harmonic distortion present in a power system, expressed as a percentage of the fundamental frequency.

### Non-linear Loads
Devices or equipment that draw current in a non-sinusoidal manner, contributing to harmonic distortion.

### Power Quality
A term that encompasses various factors, including harmonics, that affect the efficiency and safety of electrical power systems.

### Filtering
The process of reducing or eliminating harmonics to improve power quality, often using devices such as harmonic filters or tuned reactors.
