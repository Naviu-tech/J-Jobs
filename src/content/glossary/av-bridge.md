AV Bridge

An AV Bridge is a sophisticated interface device designed to facilitate the seamless integration between audiovisual (AV) systems and information technology (IT) networks. These devices are critical in modern AV setups, enabling the conversion and transmission of audio and video signals over network infrastructures. By bridging traditional AV equipment with IP-based networks, AV Bridges support the distribution of media content across various digital platforms and devices. The deployment of an AV Bridge typically requires meticulous network configuration to ensure optimal performance and compatibility with existing IT systems. Additionally, AV Bridges demand a reliable power supply and often necessitate rack mounting for secure and efficient installation within AV racks or IT data centers.

## Common Applications
