An order picker is a type of specialized lift truck designed to lift operators to elevated positions to access and retrieve goods stored on high racks. This equipment is essential in warehouses and distribution centers where goods are stored in vertical spaces. Unlike traditional forklifts, which are primarily used for transporting pallets, order pickers allow operators to select individual items directly from shelves, making them ideal for environments where orders consist of multiple small items. Order pickers are equipped with a platform for the operator to stand on, controls for maneuvering the lift, and safety features to ensure the secure retrieval of products at various heights.

## Common Applications

### Warehouse Operations
Order pickers are commonly used in warehouses to facilitate the picking process, especially in facilities that handle a wide range of products with varying sizes and shapes. They are particularly useful in warehouses that store goods in high racks, maximizing vertical space usage.

### Distribution Centers
In distribution centers, order pickers help streamline the order fulfillment process by allowing workers to quickly and efficiently retrieve items required for shipping. This equipment is essential for meeting tight deadlines and managing large volumes of orders.

### Retail and E-commerce
Order pickers are also widely used in retail and e-commerce operations where inventory turnover is high, and there is a need to pick individual items rather than entire pallets. They help in maintaining quick order turnaround times, which is crucial for customer satisfaction.

## Safety Considerations

### Operator Training
Operators must be properly trained to use order pickers safely. This includes understanding the equipmentâ€™s controls, weight capacity, and emergency procedures.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Operators should wear appropriate PPE, such as helmets and safety harnesses, to protect against falls and other potential hazards while operating at heights.

### Regular Maintenance
Regular maintenance and inspections are crucial to ensure that the order picker is functioning correctly and safely. This includes checking the lift mechanisms, brakes, and emergency controls.

### Load Limits
Adhering to the load limits specified by the manufacturer is essential to prevent overloading, which could lead to accidents or equipment failure.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Forklift
A powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances. Unlike order pickers, forklifts are generally used for moving entire pallets of goods.

### Pallet Jack
A tool used to lift and move pallets. It is simpler and less versatile than an order picker but useful for moving pallets at ground level.

### Inventory Management
The process of ordering, storing, and using a company's inventory. Order pickers play a critical role in the picking and fulfillment stages of inventory management.

### Vertical Storage System
A system designed to maximize warehouse space by storing products vertically. Order pickers are essential for accessing items in these systems efficiently.
