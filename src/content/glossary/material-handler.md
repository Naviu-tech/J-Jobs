A Material Handler is a critical role within the logistics and supply chain sectors, particularly in warehouse operations. This individual is tasked with the movement, organization, and staging of materials, which can range from raw materials to finished products, for the purposes of shipping, storage, or further processing. Material Handlers play a vital part in maintaining the flow of goods within a warehouse, ensuring that items are accurately tracked, efficiently moved, and properly stored to optimize space and accessibility.
