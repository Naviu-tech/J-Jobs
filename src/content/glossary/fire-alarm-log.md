A Fire Alarm Log is an essential document maintained by building personnel that serves as a comprehensive record of all events, tests, and maintenance activities related to a buildingâ€™s fire alarm system. This log is required by safety regulations and is crucial for ensuring the fire alarm system is functioning correctly and consistently. It provides a chronological account of all incidents, including fire alarms, system malfunctions, and scheduled maintenance activities. The log also includes details about periodic tests conducted to verify the system's reliability and efficiency. By maintaining an accurate and up-to-date fire alarm log, building managers can ensure compliance with safety standards, facilitate efficient troubleshooting, and provide vital information for fire safety audits and investigations.

## Common Applications
