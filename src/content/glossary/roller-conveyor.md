A roller conveyor is a mechanical system designed to transport goods or materials along a predetermined pathway using a series of cylindrical rollers. These rollers are set within a frame that permits items to glide smoothly over the surface. Roller conveyors are typically employed in environments where the movement of materials is needed, such as assembly lines, distribution centers, and sorting facilities. They are favored for their efficiency in moving large volumes of items with minimal manual effort. Depending on the application, roller conveyors can be powered or unpowered (gravity-driven), made from a variety of materials, and configured in straight, curved, or spiraled layouts to suit specific operational needs.

## Common Applications

### Manufacturing and Assembly Lines
Roller conveyors are extensively used in manufacturing settings to facilitate the assembly process. Items can be easily moved from one workstation to another, enhancing productivity and reducing handling times.

### Warehousing and Distribution
In warehouses and distribution centers, roller conveyors are crucial for sorting and transporting packages and goods. They streamline the process of loading and unloading trucks and moving items to their designated storage areas.

### Packaging Industry
Roller conveyors assist in the packaging industry by moving products through various stages of the packaging process, including labeling, sealing, and boxing.

## Safety Considerations

### Employee Training
Proper training should be provided to employees working with roller conveyors to ensure they understand how to operate the machinery safely and efficiently.

### Guarding and Protection
Install appropriate guarding and protective devices to prevent accidental contact with moving parts, particularly in powered roller conveyor systems.

### Regular Maintenance
Routine maintenance checks should be conducted to ensure the conveyor system is functioning correctly and to prevent potential safety hazards caused by mechanical failure.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Gravity Conveyor
A type of roller conveyor that relies on gravity to move items. It is typically used for downward slopes or in areas where powered movement is unnecessary.

### Belt Conveyor
Unlike roller conveyors, belt conveyors use a continuous loop of material (the belt) to transport goods. They are often used for items that require stable support.

### Pallet Conveyor
Designed specifically for moving pallets, these conveyors can be a subtype of roller conveyors but are built to handle heavier loads and larger items.
