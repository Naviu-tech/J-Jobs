An IP Camera, also known as an Internet Protocol Camera, is a type of digital video camera that uses the Internet Protocol to transmit and receive data over a network. Unlike traditional analog closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, IP cameras do not require a local recording device, as they can send and store data over the internet. This capability allows for higher resolution video, often reaching up to 4K, and facilitates advanced features such as video analytics, motion detection, and remote access. Users can monitor IP cameras in real-time from any location with an internet connection, making them highly versatile for various surveillance needs.

## Common Applications

### Residential Surveillance
IP cameras are widely used in residential settings for home security. They are often installed at entry points, garages, and around the perimeter of the property to monitor for intrusions or suspicious activities.

### Commercial and Industrial Security
Businesses utilize IP cameras to secure premises, monitor employee activity, and ensure safety compliance. In industrial settings, they can be used to oversee operations, detect hazards, and prevent theft.

### Public Safety
IP cameras are essential tools for law enforcement and public safety agencies. They are deployed in public spaces like parks, streets, and transportation hubs to enhance security and monitor for criminal activities.

### Retail Loss Prevention
Retailers use IP cameras to prevent theft, monitor customer activity, and improve store operations by analyzing foot traffic patterns.

## Safety Considerations

### Data Security
Since IP cameras transmit data over the internet, they are susceptible to hacking and unauthorized access. Implementing strong passwords, encrypting data, and using secure network connections are crucial to protecting the footage.

### Privacy Concerns
The use of IP cameras raises privacy issues, especially in public or semi-public areas. It is important to comply with local laws and regulations regarding surveillance and inform individuals of their presence when required.

### Network Bandwidth
High-resolution IP cameras can consume significant network bandwidth, which may affect the performance of other network-connected devices. Proper network planning and infrastructure are needed to support these devices efficiently.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Network Video Recorder (NVR)
An NVR is a device that records video in a digital format to a disk drive, USB flash drive, or other mass storage devices. It is typically used in conjunction with IP cameras to store and manage footage.

### CCTV
Closed-Circuit Television refers to a system of analog cameras connected to a local recording device. Unlike IP cameras, CCTV systems do not transmit data over a network.

### PoE (Power over Ethernet)
PoE allows IP cameras to receive power and data through a single Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for separate power supplies and simplifying installation.

### Video Analytics
An advanced feature of many IP cameras, video analytics involves the automatic analysis of video footage to detect events, identify objects, and trigger alerts based on predefined criteria.
