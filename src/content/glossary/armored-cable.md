Armored Cable, often referred to as Type AC or MC cable, is an electrical cable with a metal cladding designed to protect the internal conductors. This cable type offers enhanced physical protection compared to non-armored cables and provides a more straightforward installation process than traditional conduit systems. The metal cladding, which typically consists of steel or aluminum, acts as a durable barrier against physical damage, environmental elements, and electromagnetic interference. Armored cables are known for their flexibility, ease of handling, and ability to be installed in confined spaces without the need for extra conduit, making them a popular choice in various construction and industrial applications.

## Common Applications

### Residential and Commercial Buildings
Armored cables are extensively used in residential and commercial buildings for power distribution and branch circuits. They are ideal for applications where the wiring needs to be protected against physical damage, such as in walls or ceilings.

### Industrial Settings
In industrial environments, armored cables are employed to power machinery and equipment. Their robust design makes them suitable for areas where cables may be exposed to harsh conditions or mechanical stress.

### Outdoor Installations
Armored cables are suitable for outdoor installations, providing protection against environmental factors such as moisture, UV radiation, and corrosion.

## Safety Considerations

### Physical Protection
The metal cladding on armored cables offers significant physical protection, reducing the risk of damage during installation and operation. However, it is essential to ensure that the cladding does not become compromised, as any breach could expose the conductors and increase the risk of electrical hazards.

### Grounding
Proper grounding of armored cables is crucial to prevent electrical shocks and ensure safety. The metal cladding can often serve as a grounding path, but it is vital to adhere to local electrical codes and standards when installing these cables.

### Installation Standards
Installers should follow all relevant codes and standards, such as the National Electrical Code (NEC) in the United States, to ensure safe and compliant installation of armored cables.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Conduit Systems
Conduit systems are alternative methods for protecting electrical wiring using tubes made of metal or plastic. Unlike armored cables, conduit systems typically require additional installation steps, such as threading wires through the conduit, which can be more labor-intensive.

### Flexible Metal Conduit (FMC)
Flexible Metal Conduit is similar to armored cable but typically lacks the integrated conductors found in Type AC or MC cables. FMC is often used in applications requiring flexibility and ease of movement.

### Non-Metallic Sheathed Cable (NM)
Non-Metallic Sheathed Cable, often referred to as Romex, is a type of electrical wiring that does not have metal cladding. It is used in residential wiring but lacks the physical protection offered by armored cables.
