A Relay Module in the context of the fire alarm industry is an addressable device that plays a crucial role in the integration and control of auxiliary equipment within a fire alarm system. This module provides a dry contact closure, which is an essential feature for interfacing with various types of equipment, such as fans, doors, elevators, and other building systems that need to be controlled or activated in the event of a fire or emergency. By being addressable, the relay module can be individually identified and controlled within the larger fire alarm network, allowing for precise and reliable operation. This capability is vital for ensuring that the correct responses are triggered during an emergency, enhancing overall safety and system efficiency.

## Common Applications

### Integration with HVAC Systems
Relay modules are commonly used to control Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in response to fire events. By shutting down or adjusting these systems, the spread of smoke can be minimized, improving safety for building occupants.

### Control of Fire Doors and Dampers
In the event of a fire, relay modules can be used to automatically close fire doors and dampers, helping to contain the fire and prevent it from spreading to other areas of the building.

### Elevator Recall
Relay modules are utilized to send elevators to specific floors or to the ground floor during a fire, preventing their use by building occupants and ensuring they do not stop on floors where a fire is active.

### Emergency Lighting Activation
During an emergency, relay modules can be used to activate emergency lighting systems, ensuring that exit paths are well illuminated for safe evacuation.

## Safety Considerations

### Reliable Operation
It is imperative that relay modules are tested and maintained regularly to ensure they operate reliably during an emergency. Failure of these devices can lead to critical safety systems not being activated.

### Compatibility and Compliance
Relay modules must be compatible with the fire alarm control panel and comply with local fire safety regulations and standards. This ensures that they function correctly within the system and provide the necessary safety functions.

### Isolation and Protection
To prevent false activations or damage from power surges, relay modules should be properly isolated and protected. Using surge protectors and ensuring proper wiring can mitigate these risks.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Dry Contact
A type of electrical contact that does not carry any voltage or current when it is not activated. It is used in relay modules to control other systems without interference.

### Addressable Fire Alarm System
A type of fire alarm system where each device has a unique address, allowing for precise identification and control of individual devices within the system.

### Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP)
The central hub of a fire alarm system that monitors inputs and controls outputs, including the activation of relay modules, to manage the system's response to fire events.

### Auxiliary Equipment
Additional systems or devices that can be controlled or activated by the fire alarm system through relay modules, such as HVAC systems, elevators, and lighting systems.
