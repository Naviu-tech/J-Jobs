A Pick-to-Light System is an advanced order picking solution used in warehouses and distribution centers to streamline the order fulfillment process. It relies on a network of LED lights and displays installed on racks, shelves, or bins, which are used to guide warehouse workers to the exact locations of items that need to be picked. When an order is processed, the system illuminates the LED at the specific location where the item is stored, and the worker is then directed to that spot. The light module typically includes a display showing the quantity to pick, and a button to confirm the pick, which is pressed once the item is retrieved. This system significantly increases picking efficiency and accuracy by reducing the time spent searching for items and lowering the chances of picking errors. It is particularly useful in environments with high SKU counts and where speed and precision are critical.

## Common Applications

### Warehousing and Distribution Centers
Pick-to-Light systems are widely used in warehousing and distribution centers to fulfill customer orders quickly and accurately. They are particularly beneficial in operations with a high volume of small item picks, where speed and accuracy are paramount.

### E-commerce Fulfillment
In the e-commerce industry, where rapid order fulfillment is a competitive advantage, Pick-to-Light systems help ensure that orders are processed efficiently and correctly, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Manufacturing and Assembly
In manufacturing environments, Pick-to-Light systems are utilized to guide workers in parts picking for assembly lines, ensuring that the correct components are picked and assembled, thereby improving production quality and efficiency.

## Safety Considerations

### Ergonomics
The design and layout of Pick-to-Light systems should consider ergonomic principles to minimize the risk of repetitive strain injuries. Proper placement of lights and displays can help reduce unnecessary reaching or bending.

### Electrical Safety
As with any system involving electronic components, ensuring that all wiring and connections are safely installed and maintained is crucial to preventing electrical hazards in the workplace.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Pick-by-Voice Systems
An alternative to Pick-to-Light, Pick-by-Voice systems use audio instructions to guide workers to picking locations. They are often used in conjunction with or as an alternative to light-based systems.

### Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS)
These systems complement Pick-to-Light systems by automating the storage and retrieval of items, further enhancing warehouse efficiency.

### Barcode Scanning
Often integrated with Pick-to-Light systems, barcode scanning adds an additional layer of accuracy by verifying that the correct item is picked before moving on to the next task.
