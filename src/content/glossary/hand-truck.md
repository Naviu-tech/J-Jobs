A hand truck, also known as a dolly, is a manually operated, two-wheeled cart designed to transport heavy or bulky items over short distances, typically within environments such as warehouses, storage facilities, or retail spaces. It consists of a flat platform or toe plate at the bottom that slides under the load, a supportive back frame, and handles at the top, making it easy for the operator to tilt and maneuver the load. The design leverages basic principles of physics, allowing users to move substantial weights with minimal effort by redistributing the weight and reducing friction. Hand trucks are invaluable in material handling, facilitating the efficient movement of goods while reducing the risk of injury associated with manual lifting.

## Common Applications

- **Warehouses:** Used extensively for moving boxes, crates, and other heavy items from storage shelves to loading docks or packing areas.
- **Retail Stores:** Assists in stocking shelves, transporting inventory from storage rooms to the sales floor.
- **Delivery Services:** Essential for delivery personnel to transport large packages from vehicles to customer locations.
- **Event Management:** Useful for setting up and taking down equipment, chairs, and tables at event venues.
- **Manufacturing Plants:** Helps in moving raw materials and finished products between different production stages.

## Safety Considerations

- **Load Limits:** Always adhere to the manufacturer's specified weight limit to prevent damage to the hand truck and injury to the operator.
- **Proper Positioning:** Ensure the load is balanced and centered on the toe plate to maintain stability during movement.
- **Clear Pathways:** The path should be free of obstacles to avoid trips and falls.
- **Correct Posture:** Maintain an upright posture while operating to prevent back strain.
- **Secure Loads:** Use straps or other securing methods to prevent the load from shifting or falling during transport.

## Related Terms or Concepts

- **Dolly:** A broader term that includes various types of wheeled carts, not limited to two-wheeled configurations.
- **Pallet Jack:** A tool used to lift and move pallets, often used for heavier loads and longer distances.
- **Trolley:** Typically refers to a platform on wheels, often with more than two wheels, used for transporting goods.
- **Cart:** A general term for a wheeled vehicle, often with more than two wheels, used for transporting items.
- **Ergonomics:** The design and arrangement of equipment to minimize physical strain and maximize efficiency, crucial in the design of material handling equipment like hand trucks.
