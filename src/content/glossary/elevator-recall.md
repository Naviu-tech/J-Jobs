Elevator Recall is a critical safety feature integrated into building fire alarm systems, designed to enhance occupant safety during emergencies. Upon activation of the fire alarm system, the Elevator Recall function automatically overrides normal elevator operations to return all elevators to a predetermined landing, typically the building's main floor or another designated safe area. This procedure ensures that elevators are not used during a fire, as they may become unsafe or inoperative, and facilitates the safe evacuation of building occupants by preventing elevator access to floors where fire may be present.

## Common Applications

### Commercial Buildings
Elevator Recall is widely implemented in commercial buildings such as office towers, shopping centers, and hotels. These structures often have multiple floors and high occupant density, necessitating reliable evacuation routes and preventing elevator usage during fires.

### Residential High-Rises
In residential high-rise buildings, Elevator Recall is crucial for ensuring residents can evacuate safely. It allows emergency responders to control elevator operations, ensuring they arrive at the designated recall floor for safe evacuation or firefighter use.

### Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities
Hospitals and healthcare facilities incorporate Elevator Recall to ensure patients and staff can be evacuated safely without relying on elevators, which may pose a risk during a fire.

## Safety Considerations

### Compliance with Codes and Standards
Elevator Recall systems must comply with local and national fire safety codes and standards, such as those outlined by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Regular inspections and maintenance are necessary to ensure system reliability and functionality.

### Accessibility
Elevator Recall must consider the needs of individuals with disabilities, providing clear instructions and alternatives for safe evacuation when elevators are unavailable.

### Integration with Fire Alarm Systems
Proper integration with the building’s fire alarm system is essential for Elevator Recall to function effectively. This includes ensuring that the alarm system can accurately trigger the recall process in a timely manner.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Fire Service Mode
A secondary function that allows firefighters to manually control elevators during an emergency, often activated after the initial Elevator Recall process.

### Fire Alarm System
A network of devices that detect and warn of fire presence, crucial for initiating Elevator Recall and other emergency protocols.

### Designated Landing
The specific floor to which elevators are recalled during an emergency, typically chosen for its safety and accessibility to emergency personnel.

### Emergency Evacuation Plan
A comprehensive strategy outlining procedures for safely evacuating a building’s occupants, often including guidelines for Elevator Recall and stairwell usage.
